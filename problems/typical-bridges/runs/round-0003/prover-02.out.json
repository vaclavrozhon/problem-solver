  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Finalize Conjecture 1 via the forgetful map \u03c0 from rooted to unrooted spaces: prove \u03c0 is continuous, open, and surjective, and transfer nowhere\u2011denseness and meagreness (for Baire\u2011property sets). This removes any reliance on \u201csaturation preserves nowhere\u2011denseness\u201d (false in general).\n- Strengthen the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d for Conjecture 2 in cylinder\u2011type topologies by completing the odd\u2011D bridge\u2011forcing gadget inside a ball and giving an even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing gadget, both as cylinder refinements. Add an invariance lemma for section metrics under bounded re\u2011rootings.\n- Propose and analyze a genuinely non\u2011local, rootless \u201coccurrence topology\u201d \ud835\udcaf_occ on unrooted graphs; prove density of both \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d and \u201cbridgeless\u201d therein. Baire status remains to be settled; if Baire and both dense, neither property is typical in \ud835\udcaf_occ.\n\nRigorous statements and proofs\n\nSetup. Let D\u22652. Let X:=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,D} be rooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D), under the local metric d_{\u2022}. Let \ud835\udd3d be the countable set of rooted r\u2011ball types (all r).\n\nUnrooted space Y and the forgetful map.\n- Let Y be the set of unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D), endowed with the rootless local topology generated by U_Y(F):={G\u2208Y: \u2203v B_r(G,v)\u2245F} for F\u2208\ud835\udd3d. Define \u03c0:X\u2192Y by \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma 1 (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective).\n- Continuity: \u03c0^{-1}(U_Y(F))=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F} is open in X.\n- Openness: \u03c0(\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F})=U_Y(F).\n- Surjective: any G\u2208Y admits some root \u03c1; then (G,\u03c1)\u2208X and \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma 2 (X and Y are Baire). For \u0394\u2264D, both X and Y are compact metrizable (hence Baire). For \u0394= D\u2011regular, they are closed subspaces of the \u0394\u2264D spaces; thus Baire.\nSketch. For X (\u0394\u2264D): compactness by diagonal extraction on rooted balls; limits preserve local finiteness and connectivity. Y is the continuous, open image of compact X under \u03c0 and is Hausdorff (standard for this topology), hence compact. The regular subspaces are closed by local degree constraints.\n\nProposition 3 (Nowhere\u2011denseness transfers). For A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. If \u03c0^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense, some nonempty open U\u2286X is contained in cl_X(\u03c0^{-1}(A)); then \u03c0(U) is nonempty open and \u03c0(U)\u2286cl_Y(A), so A is not nowhere dense. Conversely, if A is not nowhere dense, pick nonempty open V\u2286cl_Y(A); then \u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and \u03c0^{-1}(V)\u2286cl_X(\u03c0^{-1}(A)), so \u03c0^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense.\n\nProposition 4 (Meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. If A is meagre, pull back a countable cover by nowhere dense sets and use Proposition 3. Conversely, write A=U\u0394M with U open and M meagre. Then \u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u03c0^{-1}(U)\u0394\u03c0^{-1}(M). If \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre, then \u03c0^{-1}(U) is meagre. But X is Baire, so \u03c0^{-1}(U)=\u2205, hence U=\u2205 by surjectivity of \u03c0. Thus A=M is meagre.\n\nCorollary 5 (Conjecture 1 for natural properties). For any Borel/analytic property P of unrooted graphs, S_P:=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in X iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in Y; smallness is root\u2011independent.\n\nBounded re\u2011rooting invariance for section metrics.\n- A section s:Y\u2192X satisfies \u03c0\u2218s=Id_Y. Define d_s(G,H):=d_{\u2022}((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).\n\nLemma 6 (Homeomorphism for bounded re\u2011rootings). If sections s,t satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264N for all G, then the identity Id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. Hence nowhere\u2011denseness and meagreness coincide under d_s,d_t.\nProof. If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))\u2245B_{r+N}(H,s(H)). Moving roots by \u2264N gives B_r(G,t(G))\u2245B_r(H,t(H)), so d_t(G,H)\u22642^{-r}. Symmetry yields the inverse continuity.\n\nOdd\u2011D bridge forcing inside a cylinder (complete gadget).\n- For a finite rooted subgraph H (a candidate refined ball), define the deficit S(H):=\u2211_{v\u2208V(H)}(D\u2212deg_H(v)). In any D\u2011regular extension, |\u03b4(V(H))|=S(H).\n- For odd D: S(H)\u2261|V(H)| (mod 2).\n\nGadgets (degree\u2011safe and layer\u2011respecting):\n- Ports: For a boundary vertex x with current deficit d_x, attach d_x disjoint 2\u2011edge paths x\u2013a\u2013b, with deg(a)=2, deg(b)=1 in the new partial graph. This moves one unit of deficit from x to b. Doing this for all boundary vertices produces S(H) ports b_i at distance +2 from the old boundary; the updated core H\u2032 has S(H\u2032)=S(H) and all original boundary vertices saturated (deg=D).\n- Pair\u2011closure: For any two ports b_i,b_j, we can connect them by a bounded D\u2011regular filler gadget disjoint from the rest that consumes both deficits and saturates all new vertices to degree D (e.g., embed both into a copy of K_{D+1}\u2212e, identifying b_i,b_j with the two degree\u2011(D\u22121) ends and adding the missing edge internally). Net effect: S decreases by 2; all additions are placed strictly beyond the current boundary, respecting BFS layers.\n- Parity flipper (odd D): Introduce a small tree T of radius 2 attached to two distinct boundary vertices before port creation to change S by an odd amount (as in the previous round). Concretely, add a new vertex z adjacent to two boundary vertices x,y; then extend z to degree D by adding a (D\u22122)\u2011regular local gadget not touching the rest. This changes S by D\u22124 (odd when D is odd), enabling a transition to S odd.\n\nLemma 7 (Reduction to a single port). Given any rooted r\u2011ball F in a D\u2011regular graph with odd D>2, there exists a finite extension H including F (respecting layers so that H is a rooted r\u2032\u2011ball) such that S(H)=1.\nProof. Start with H:=F. If S(H) is even, apply the parity flipper near the boundary to make S odd. Create ports at all boundary vertices until boundary vertices are saturated. While S>1, repeatedly apply pair\u2011closure to consume two ports at a time via disjoint filler gadgets; this preserves degrees \u2264D and does not create shortcuts to the root because all additions are outward and glued along specified boundary vertices. Termination yields S=1 with all original boundary vertices saturated and exactly one port b* remaining at the outer boundary. The resulting H is a finite connected graph which, by our outward\u2011only construction and layer control, is the r\u2032\u2011ball of its root for some r\u2032.\n\nProposition 8 (Odd\u2011D bridge forcing). In \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,=D} with odd D>2, for any cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F}, there is a refinement cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} such that every D\u2011regular extension of F\u2032 has a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense (for any cylinder\u2011based topology).\nProof. Take H from Lemma 7 with S(H)=1 and let F\u2032 be its rooted r\u2032\u2011ball. Any D\u2011regular extension G satisfies |\u03b4(V(H))|=1; the unique edge in \u03b4(V(H)) is a bridge of G.\n\nEven\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing inside a cylinder.\n- Observation: In a D\u2011regular graph with even D, 1\u2011way infinite bridges cannot occur. To force non\u20112\u2011connectedness, centralize all external deficit through a single designated cut\u2011vertex c.\n\nLemma 9. For any rooted r\u2011ball F in a D\u2011regular graph with even D>2, there exists a finite extension H containing F (again as a rooted r\u2032\u2011ball) such that in any D\u2011regular extension G of H, some vertex c\u2208V(H) is a cut vertex of G.\nProof sketch. Choose a vertex c on the boundary of F. Create ports at all other boundary vertices and pair\u2011close them as in Lemma 7 until all boundary vertices except possibly c are saturated. Route the remaining required deficit to c by attaching disjoint 2\u2011edge paths towards c and saturating intermediate vertices to degree D using local fillers, ensuring no new shorter paths to the root. Arrange that all edges leaving V(H) (there are S(H) of them, with S(H) even) are incident to c and that the removal of c disconnects H into at least two nonempty blocks (create two internally 2\u2011edge\u2011connected blobs H_1,H_2 attached to c only). In any D\u2011regular extension, all outside edges attach at c, hence removing c disconnects G. Degree constraints are preserved by construction. The same layer discipline shows H is a ball F\u2032.\n\nConsequences for Conjecture 2 (no\u2011go region)\n\n- Cylinder\u2011based invariance: The proofs of Propositions 8 and Lemma 9 are purely by cylinder refinement. Therefore, under any metric whose open sets are unions of rooted cylinders (i.e., inducing the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense in \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,\u2264D} (D>2) and in \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,=D} for odd D; and graphs without a cut vertex are nowhere dense for all D>2.\n- Bounded re\u2011rootings: By Lemma 6, section metrics that change roots within uniformly bounded distance preserve typicality; thus they cannot make bridgeless graphs typical.\n\nA genuinely non\u2011local alternative: occurrence topology \ud835\udcaf_occ on Y\n\nDefinition. Let \ud835\udd3d_r be the finite set of rooted r\u2011ball types (\u0394\u2264D). Define the map Occ:Y\u2192\u220f_{r\u22650}2^{\ud835\udd3d_r} by Occ(G)_r = {F\u2208\ud835\udd3d_r : F occurs somewhere in G}. Equip \u220f_{r}2^{\ud835\udd3d_r} with the product topology; let \ud835\udcaf_occ be the pullback topology on Y via Occ. Equivalently, a subbasic open set is U_Y(F): \u201cF occurs somewhere.\u201d\n\nLemma 10 (Density of 1\u2011way infinite bridges in \ud835\udcaf_occ). For D\u22653, the set B_1\u2286Y of graphs having a 1\u2011way infinite bridge is dense in (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ).\nProof. Given finitely many required occurrences F_1,\u2026,F_k, realize each within vertex\u2011disjoint finite subgraphs inside a finite connected core C while respecting \u0394\u2264D (use fresh vertices and avoid degree overflow). Attach an infinite ray to a vertex x\u2208C with spare degree, and ensure all other vertices of C are saturated via local fillers; then in any completion the edge on the ray out of x is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. The resulting graph contains all F_i and has \u0394\u2264D.\n\nLemma 11 (Density of bridgeless graphs in \ud835\udcaf_occ). For D\u22653, the set B_0\u2286Y of bridgeless graphs is dense in (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ).\nProof. Given finitely many required occurrences F_1,\u2026,F_k, realize them disjointly in a finite core C without creating bridges (add cycles/chords locally so every edge of C lies on a cycle). Extend C to an infinite bridgeless \u0394\u2264D graph by attaching an infinite ladder\u2011like 2\u2011edge\u2011connected \u201cbackbone\u201d (e.g., a 2\u2011edge\u2011connected cubic skeleton such as the 3\u2011regular \u201cladder of ladders\u201d) and connect C to it via two edge\u2011disjoint paths; saturate degrees with local 2\u2011edge\u2011connected fillers. This yields a connected infinite bridgeless graph containing all F_i.\n\nRemark. The Baire/Polish status of (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) remains open; we have not yet proved that Occ(Y) is closed in \u220f 2^{\ud835\udd3d_r}. If (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) is Baire and both B_1 and B_0 are dense, neither is comeagre; thus \u201cbridgeless\u201d cannot be typical under \ud835\udcaf_occ.\n\nExamples\n\n- Parity sanity check (odd D): For D=3 and a tree H on m vertices, S(H)=3m\u22122(m\u22121)=m+2 is odd iff m is odd, in line with the parity flipper\u2019s necessity.\n- Section metrics: On an infinite D\u2011regular tree T_D, picking s(G) as any root and t(G) as a neighbor gives N=1; Lemma 6 applies.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Occurrence topology: Proving that Occ(Y) is closed (hence compact) requires a projective\u2011limit consistency theorem for occurrence profiles; we currently only have necessary closure constraints (truncation monotonicity) and a heuristic that compactness should follow by a standard compactness/ultraproduct or K\u0151nig\u2019s\u2011lemma argument. A full proof is pending.\n- Even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex gadget: We provided a proof sketch; a fully explicit, layer\u2011respecting construction with precise degree bookkeeping should be written to eliminate any ambiguity.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move Lemmas 1\u20132, Propositions 3\u20134, and Lemma 6 to proofs.md to close Conjecture 1 and to record section\u2011metric invariance.\n- Write a detailed, layer\u2011respecting proof for Lemma 7 and Proposition 8 (odd\u2011D bridge forcing) with explicit filler gadgets and port pairing; ensure F\u2032 is indeed a ball.\n- Provide a complete, explicit construction for Lemma 9 (even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing), including routing of all deficits through c and verification that H is a ball.\n- Formalize \ud835\udcaf_occ: either prove (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) is Baire/compact by identifying Occ(Y) as a closed subshift, or provide a counterexample; then decide typicality of B_0 and B_1.\n\nTakeaways\n\n- Conjecture 1 is resolved for natural (Borel/analytic) properties by \u03c0\u2011transfer of nowhere\u2011denseness and meagreness.\n- Conjecture 2: In all cylinder\u2011based topologies and bounded re\u2011rooting section metrics, bridgeless graphs remain non\u2011typical (nowhere dense or not comeagre). A non\u2011local occurrence topology changes density behavior (both bridgeless and 1\u2011way\u2011bridge graphs dense), but Baire status is open; settling it will decide (non\u2011)typicality there."
