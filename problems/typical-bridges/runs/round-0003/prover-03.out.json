  "content": "Ideas\n- Strengthen and clean up Conjecture 1: formalize transfer of nowhere\u2011denseness and (for Baire\u2011property sets) meagreness between the rooted and unrooted spaces via the forgetful map \u03c0. Add a short, self\u2011contained proof that the unrooted space Y (rootless local topology) is Baire using that \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective and X is Baire.\n- Repair and simplify the odd\u2011D regular \u201cbridge\u2011forcing\u201d cylinder: construct an R\u2011ball F\u2032 with L_R consisting of a single vertex z adjacent to D\u22121 vertices in L_{R\u22121}; then S(F\u2032)=1, so every D\u2011regular extension has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. This avoids parity bookkeeping gadgets and is easier to verify.\n- Extend the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d region for Conjecture 2: any topology on X that refines the rooted cylinder topology inherits a nonempty interior for \u201chas a bridge\u201d (\u2264D) and for \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d (=D, odd), preventing bridgeless from being typical there.\n- Coarser, root\u2011insensitive topology \u03c4_any (pullback of the unrooted topology): prove Y is Baire; show in Y: \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is dense, and (for D\u22654) \u201cbridgeless\u201d is dense; thus neither can be typical in Y nor in (X,\u03c4_any). For D=3, leave density of \u201cbridgeless\u201d open.\n\nFormal statements and proofs\n1) Forgetful map framework\nSetup: X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} with the rooted local topology; Y the unrooted degree\u2011bounded space with the rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: \u2203v with B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma 1 (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective).\nProof. For a rooted r\u2011ball F, \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=U_F^X is open in X (union over all choices of root), so \u03c0 is continuous. Also \u03c0(U_F^X)=U_F^Y, hence open. Surjectivity is clear. \u220e\n\nProposition 2 (nowhere\u2011denseness transfers exactly).\nFor any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Let A be nowhere dense. For any nonempty open U\u2286X, \u03c0(U) is nonempty open in Y; choose nonempty open V\u2286\u03c0(U) with V\u2229A=\u2205. Then U\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and disjoint from \u03c0^{-1}(A). (\u21d0) If \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense and W\u2286Y is nonempty open, then \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open; pick nonempty open U\u2032\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(W) with U\u2032\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u2205. Then \u03c0(U\u2032)\u2286W is nonempty open disjoint from A. \u220e\n\nCorollary 3 (meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets).\nIf A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) meagre in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Since A has the Baire property, some nonempty open V has A\u2229V comeagre. Then \u03c0^{-1}(A\u2229V)=\u03c0^{-1}(A)\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V) is comeagre in nonempty open \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradiction. \u220e\n\n2) Y is Baire\nLemma 4 (Y is a Baire space).\nProof. X is Baire (standard for the rooted local space on degree\u2011bounded graphs). Let U_n\u2286Y be dense open. Then \u03c0^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X. Their intersection is dense in X, hence nonempty on every nonempty open O\u2286X. For any nonempty open W\u2286Y, \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X, so \u03c0^{-1}(W)\u2229\u22c2_n \u03c0^{-1}(U_n)\u2260\u2205, and applying \u03c0 (open and surjective) yields W\u2229\u22c2_n U_n\u2260\u2205. Hence \u22c2_n U_n is dense. \u220e\n\nWhy useful: Typicality in \u03c4_any (the pullback of Y) is governed by Y; in particular, if both a set and its complement are dense in Y, neither can be typical in \u03c4_any.\n\n3) Odd\u2011D regular bridge\u2011forcing cylinder\nProposition 5 (odd D\u22653). Let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) occur in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exist R\u2265r and an R\u2011ball F\u2032 extending F with the following properties:\n- All vertices at distance <R from the root in F\u2032 have degree D (inside F\u2032).\n- The boundary L_R of F\u2032 consists of a single vertex z, and deg_{F\u2032}(z)=D\u22121.\nConsequently, for any D\u2011regular extension G\u2032 of F\u2032, the cut \u03b4(V(B_R(G\u2032,\u03c1))) has size 1, so the unique crossing edge is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof. Starting from F, extend outward layer by layer to radius R\u22121 so that L_{R\u22121} contains at least D\u22121 vertices (this is possible by attaching enough new vertices outward from L_r; at each step, saturate layers < current boundary to degree D by allocating their remaining degree to the newly created outer layer). At the last step, create L_R={z} and connect z to D\u22121 distinct vertices in L_{R\u22121}, adding no edges within L_R. All vertices at distance <R are saturated to degree D by construction. Then S(F\u2032)=\u2211_{x\u2208L_R}(D\u2212deg_{F\u2032}x)=D\u2212(D\u22121)=1. In any D\u2011regular supergraph, by the edge\u2011cut identity |\u03b4(V(B_R))|=S(F\u2032)=1; hence the sole edge leaving B_R is a bridge whose interior side is finite, i.e., a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Nonemptiness: realize an extension by connecting z to one new vertex w outside B_R and completing outside to an infinite D\u2011regular graph (e.g., a D\u2011regular tree modified to eliminate bridges far from B_R if desired; completion is routine since only degrees outside need to be filled). \u220e\n\nCorollary 6 (no\u2011go for \u201cbridgeless typical\u201d under cylinder\u2011refining topologies).\n- In \u2264D: the 1\u2011ball with a leaf at the root is a cylinder contained in \u201chas a bridge\u201d, giving nonempty interior. Hence \u201cbridgeless\u201d cannot be comeagre.\n- In =D, D odd: by Proposition 5, there is a cylinder contained in \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d; thus \u201cbridgeless\u201d cannot be comeagre.\nThis applies to any topology on X that contains all rooted cylinders as open sets (hence to any metric topologically finer than or equivalent to d_\u2022).\n\n4) Density facts in the unrooted space Y\nLemma 7 (1\u2011way infinite bridges are dense in Y for \u2264D).\nProof. Let U_F^Y be a basic open set (F an r\u2011ball). Since F occurs in some graph with \u0394\u2264D, it has a boundary vertex u\u2208L_r with deg_F(u)<D (Lemma 13\u2011type observation). Attach a pendant infinite ray to u, and complete arbitrarily elsewhere without changing the r\u2011ball around the occurrence of F. The first edge of the ray is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Thus U_F^Y intersects the set of graphs with a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. \u220e\n\nProposition 8 (for D\u22654, bridgeless graphs are dense in Y).\nProof. Fix U_F^Y. Consider the infinite grid Z^2 (degree 4), which is bridgeless. Subdivide finitely many edges of Z^2 inside a large finite box so that F embeds as a subgraph; subdivisions preserve bridgelessness and keep maximum degree \u22644. If D>4, freely append pendant 2\u2011paths to split degrees down to \u2264D (or take Cartesian products with cycles to reach degree exactly D and then subdivide). Thus for D\u22654 we obtain a bridgeless G with \u0394(G)\u2264D that contains an occurrence of F, so G\u2208U_F^Y. \u220e\nRemark. For D=3, finding a fixed universal bridgeless host is subtler; density of bridgeless graphs in Y for D=3 is left open here.\n\n5) Bounded re\u2011rooting invariance\nLemma 9. If T:X\u2192X maps (G,\u03c1)\u21a6(G,\u03c1\u2032) with d_G(\u03c1,\u03c1\u2032)\u2264B uniformly, then T is a homeomorphism of (X,d_\u2022) onto its image; hence any \u201csection metric\u201d obtained by such re\u2011rootings is topologically equivalent to d_\u2022.\nProof. For each r, U_{r+B}(x)\u2286T^{-1}(U_r(Tx))\u2286U_{r\u2212B}(x), yielding continuity of T and T^{-1} on their domains. \u220e\n\nExamples\n- Odd\u2011D gadget check for D=3: Take R so that |L_{R\u22121}|\u22652. Set L_R={z} and connect z to two distinct vertices of L_{R\u22121}. Then deg_{F\u2032}(z)=2, so S(F\u2032)=1.\n- Density of 1\u2011way bridges in Y for \u2264D: If F\u2019s boundary has no degree deficit (e.g., F comes from an =D occurrence), enlarge r by one and take F\u2032 with a boundary deficit at the new layer; then apply the same ray attachment.\n\nObstacles\n- Even D regular case: we cannot force a 1\u2011way infinite bridge (parity obstruction). Constructing a cylinder that forces a genuine 2\u2011way infinite bridge in =D, D even, remains open. The current interior \u201cno\u2011go\u201d uses cut\u2011vertices instead of bridges; while useful (Theorem 15), it does not by itself preclude the possibility that \u201cbridgeless\u201d could be comeagre under some very nonlocal topology.\n- Density of bridgeless graphs in Y for D=3: a uniform bridgeless host accommodating arbitrary finite degree\u2011\u22643 patterns as subgraphs is nontrivial. A tailored external 2\u2011edge\u2011connected completion attached by two disjoint connections should work, but a clean, degree\u2011bounded, fully general construction needs care.\n- \u03c4_any on X (preimage of Y\u2019s topology): By Lemma 4, Y is Baire; \u03c0:(X,\u03c4_any)\u2192Y is open and continuous. Typicality of saturated properties in (X,\u03c4_any) matches Y\u2019s. For non\u2011saturated properties, category analysis requires separate work.\n\nNext steps\n- Move Lemma 1, Proposition 2, Corollary 3, and Lemma 4 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 for Borel/Baire\u2011property properties.\n- Write a full, layer\u2011by\u2011layer construction for Proposition 5, including the degree\u2011saturation algorithm up to radius R\u22121, and the completion argument beyond B_R.\n- Extend the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d corollary to any topology \u03c4 on X with the property that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is open (or more generally, that for some fixed finite pattern P witnessing a bridge, the set \u201ccontains P at bounded distance from the root\u201d is open). Record the precise hypotheses.\n- For Conjecture 2, analyze even D in =D: either build an explicit R\u2011ball forcing a 2\u2011way infinite bridge, or prove a universal obstruction. In parallel, for D=3 establish density of bridgeless graphs in Y by a degree\u2011bounded 2\u2011edge\u2011connected completion scheme around arbitrary F.\n- If pursuing \u03c4_any, describe an explicit complete metric inducing Y\u2019s topology (and hence \u03c4_any on X via pullback), to allow a black\u2011box Baire proof and to compare typical sets rigorously.\n"
