X=\ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,D} with Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology \u03c4_\u2022. Y=unrooted connected countable graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) endowed with the rootless-local topology \u03c4\u2080 generated by basic opens U_F^Y={G\u2208Y: \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F}.\\n- Lemma A (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective). \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G, is continuous and open: \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{v\u2208V(F)} \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{(F,v)} is open; images of cylinder opens are the U_F^Y.\\n- Proposition A1 (ND equivalence). For any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080) iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4_\u2022). Proof: continuity+openness give int(cl(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(int(cl(A))).\\n- Proposition A2 (Meagre equivalence for BP sets). If A has the Baire property in (Y,\u03c4\u2080) (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) meagre in X. Proof via images/preimages of dense G_\u03b4 and openness of \u03c0.\\n- Lemma A3 (bounded re-rootings preserve topology). For section metrics d_s(G,H)=d_\u2022((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))), if dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; inequalities d_t\u22642^{K}d_s and d_s\u22642^{K}d_t follow from ball containment. Consequence: typicality is root-invariant across such section metrics.\\n\\n2) Conjecture 2 (no-go via finite-lens pinning): corrected odd-D regular bridge gadget\\n\\n- FLP (finite-lens property). A metric/topology on X has FLP if every nonempty open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) which pins the radius-r neighborhoods of finitely many marked vertices (i.e., all incidences and non-incidences among those vertices up to radius r are specified).\\n- Theorem B (BrFree is nowhere dense in any FLP metric; =D odd). Fix odd D\u22653. In (\ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D}, d) with FLP, the set BrFree of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.\\n  Proof. Let O be nonempty open; by FLP, O\u2287W(M). We refine to W\u2032=W(M\u2032) by grafting a finite connected seed S whose vertices are all newly added and whose radius-1 neighborhoods are fully pinned:\\n  Seed S (explicit). Let n=D+2 (odd). Start from K_n with distinguished vertices x,a,b and the remaining set W of size D\u22121 (even). Delete edges xa and xb; delete a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D\u22121; for v\u2260x, deg_S(v)=D. S is connected. Now embed S disjointly from the marks at distance \u2265r+2 inside the cylinder, pinning all adjacencies among vertices of S. In any D-regular completion, vertices v\u2260x already have degree D entirely within the pinned region; hence no external edges can attach to them. Vertex x has degree D\u22121 within S, thus must have exactly one external neighbor. Therefore \u03b4(S)=1 and the unique cross edge is incident with x, making that edge a bridge in every completion. Hence O contains an open subset disjoint from BrFree. As O was arbitrary, BrFree is nowhere dense.\\n  Parity note. \u03b4(S)=\u2211_{v\u2208S}(D\u2212deg_S(v))=1 because exactly one vertex has a unit deficit and D is odd, making |S| odd consistent with handshake parity.\\n- Corollary B1. In any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D}, BrFree is nowhere dense by the usual leaf-attachment in the pinned region.\\n- Proposition B2 (finer-topology no-go). If \u03c4\u2082 refines \u03c4\u2081 on X and S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2081), then S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2082). Hence no metric finer than Benjamini\u2013Schramm can make BrFree typical.\\n\\n3) Even-D regular case: forcing a cut vertex under FLP\\n\\n- Proposition C (NoCut is nowhere dense under FLP; =D even). For even D\u22654, in any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D}, the set NoCut={graphs without a cut vertex} is nowhere dense.\\n  Proof. Let O\u2287W(M). Insert a finite pinned gadget S with all vertices degree D within S except one vertex x with degree D\u22122. Explicit S: start from K_{D,D} with bipartition A\u222aB; pick x\u2208A, y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B. Remove edges x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082; add edge y\u2081\u2212y\u2082. Degrees: deg_S(x)=D\u22122; all other vertices degree D; S connected. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods of all vertices of S and place S far from existing marks. In any D-regular completion, only x can accept external edges, and exactly two are needed. Thus all cross edges are incident to x; removing x separates S\\\\{x} from the rest, so x is a cut vertex. Therefore O contains an open subset disjoint from NoCut. Hence NoCut is nowhere dense.\\n\\n4) Beyond FLP: a topological no-go scheme via finite pinning\\n\\n- Definition (FPP: finite pinning property). A topology \u03c4 on X has FPP if for every nonempty open O and some x\u2208O, there exists an FLP-cylinder W(M) with x\u2208W(M)\u2286O.\\n- Proposition D (BrFree nowhere dense under FPP; \u2264D and =D odd). If \u03c4 has FPP, then the proofs of Theorem B and Corollary B1 go through verbatim, hence BrFree is nowhere dense. Similarly, for even D regular, NoCut is nowhere dense.\\n  Use: This extends the no-go to any \u201creasonable\u201d topology with finite pinning subbasis; typicality cannot flip there.\\n\\n5) Coarser, root-insensitive topology and density phenomena\\n\\n- Define \u03c4_any on Y as the quotient topology from (X,\u03c4_\u2022) via \u03c0, equivalently generated by U_F^Y. Then \u03c0 is open and continuous; \u03c4_any is coarser than \u03c4_\u2022 (on X via pullback) and root-insensitive.\\n- Lemma E (Density of 1-way infinite bridges in \u03c4_any; \u2264D). For any nonempty U_F^Y, construct a completion containing F and attach an infinite ray R to some interior vertex u by a single edge e, respecting degree \u2264D (choose u with spare capacity or pre-insert a bounded-degree buffer inside the copy of F). The resulting graph lies in U_F^Y and has a 1-way infinite bridge e. Hence {G: has a 1-way infinite bridge} is dense in (Y,\u03c4_any).\\n- Heuristic (bridgeless density). In many cases, preserving F and completing the graph to be 2-edge-connected away from the pinned finite region is also possible, suggesting bridgeless graphs may be dense as well. If (Y,\u03c4_any) were Baire, disjoint density would preclude either being comeagre, ruling out \u201cbridgeless typical\u201d in \u03c4_any. However, T\u2081/Baire status of \u03c4_any is subtle: \u03c0^{-1}({G}) need not be closed in X, so \u03c4_any may fail T\u2081, complicating category analysis.\\n\\n6) Examples/checks\\n\\n- Odd D=3, seed S instance. K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w\u2081,w\u2082. Remove xa, xb, and w\u2081w\u2082. Degrees: deg(x)=2=D\u22121, others 3. Pinning S as above forces exactly one cross edge at x in any 3-regular completion, hence a bridge.\\n- Even D=4, cut gadget. K_{4,4} with parts A,B; pick x\u2208A,y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B. Remove x\u2212y\u2081, x\u2212y\u2082 and add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082. Degrees: deg(x)=2=D\u22122, others 4. Only x has external capacity; removing x disconnects, so x is a cut vertex in any 4-regular completion.\\n\\n7) Obstacles and clarifications\\n\\n- Saturation caveat. Saturating a nowhere dense set in X under re-rooting can produce a dense meagre set; thus \u03c0-based arguments (Propositions A1\u2013A2) are essential for root-invariance.\\n- \u03c4_any Baire status. Though \u03c4_any is the quotient of compact (X,\u03c4_\u2022), quotient need not be Hausdorff/T\u2081; Baire property is unsettled here. Any claim about typicality in \u03c4_any must await a structural analysis (T\u2081/T\u2080, Baire, possibly quasi-Polish).\\n\\n8) Next steps (concrete tasks)\\n\\n- Write up full proofs of Propositions A1\u2013A2 and Lemma A3 in proofs.md (this settles Conjecture 1 for all BP properties).\\n- Add detailed proof of Theorem B (odd D) and Proposition C (even D) with the explicit seeds S into proofs.md, stating the pinning precisely (radius-1 neighborhoods of S vertices) and the degree-capacity argument in =D spaces.\\n- Formalize FPP and record Proposition D to broaden the no-go region for Conjecture 2.\\n- Analyze \u03c4_any: establish separation axioms, and attempt to prove Baire or quasi-Polish. If Baire and both BrFree and \u201chas 1-way infinite bridge\u201d are dense, conclude neither is typical in \u03c4_any.\\n- For even D-regular, mirror the FLP no-go to the \u201cno cut vertex\u201d property in more general topologies with FPP; document the precise gadget and argument.\\n\\nWhy these are useful\\n\\n- The corrected odd-D gadget plugs a key gap and yields robust \u201cno-go\u201d for making bridgeless typical across a wide class of local metrics/topologies.\\n- The \u03c0-transfer resolves Conjecture 1 for all natural (BP) properties cleanly and generally.\\n- The even-D cut-vertex gadget extends typicality obstruction to the regular even case, aligning with Theorem 15 and transferring to FLP/FPP settings.\\n- The \u03c4_any density result identifies a promising coarser regime where behavior changes, focusing future work on its Baire status to settle Conjecture 2 in either direction.\\n\"}",
