1) Conjecture 1 (root-invariance): formal π-transfer and section metrics

- Setup. X=𝔾_{\bullet,D} with Benjamini–Schramm topology τ_•. Y=unrooted connected countable graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) endowed with the rootless-local topology τ₀ generated by basic opens U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}.
- Lemma A (π is continuous, open, surjective). π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous and open: π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v∈V(F)} 𝔾_{\bullet}^{(F,v)} is open; images of cylinder opens are the U_F^Y.
- Proposition A1 (ND equivalence). For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,τ₀) iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,τ_•). Proof: continuity+openness give int(cl(π^{-1}(A)))⊆π^{-1}(int(cl(A))).
- Proposition A2 (Meagre equivalence for BP sets). If A has the Baire property in (Y,τ₀) (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) meagre in X. Proof via images/preimages of dense G_δ and openness of π.
- Lemma A3 (bounded re-rootings preserve topology). For section metrics d_s(G,H)=d_•((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))), if dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; inequalities d_t≤2^{K}d_s and d_s≤2^{K}d_t follow from ball containment. Consequence: typicality is root-invariant across such section metrics.

2) Conjecture 2 (no-go via finite-lens pinning): corrected odd-D regular bridge gadget

- FLP (finite-lens property). A metric/topology on X has FLP if every nonempty open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) which pins the radius-r neighborhoods of finitely many marked vertices (i.e., all incidences and non-incidences among those vertices up to radius r are specified).
- Theorem B (BrFree is nowhere dense in any FLP metric; =D odd). Fix odd D≥3. In (𝔾_{\bullet,=D}, d) with FLP, the set BrFree of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.
  Proof. Let O be nonempty open; by FLP, O⊇W(M). We refine to W′=W(M′) by grafting a finite connected seed S whose vertices are all newly added and whose radius-1 neighborhoods are fully pinned:
  Seed S (explicit). Let n=D+2 (odd). Start from K_n with distinguished vertices x,a,b and the remaining set W of size D−1 (even). Delete edges xa and xb; delete a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D−1; for v≠x, deg_S(v)=D. S is connected. Now embed S disjointly from the marks at distance ≥r+2 inside the cylinder, pinning all adjacencies among vertices of S. In any D-regular completion, vertices v≠x already have degree D entirely within the pinned region; hence no external edges can attach to them. Vertex x has degree D−1 within S, thus must have exactly one external neighbor. Therefore δ(S)=1 and the unique cross edge is incident with x, making that edge a bridge in every completion. Hence O contains an open subset disjoint from BrFree. As O was arbitrary, BrFree is nowhere dense.
  Parity note. δ(S)=∑_{v∈S}(D−deg_S(v))=1 because exactly one vertex has a unit deficit and D is odd, making |S| odd consistent with handshake parity.
- Corollary B1. In any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D}, BrFree is nowhere dense by the usual leaf-attachment in the pinned region.
- Proposition B2 (finer-topology no-go). If τ₂ refines τ₁ on X and S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₁), then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₂). Hence no metric finer than Benjamini–Schramm can make BrFree typical.

3) Even-D regular case: forcing a cut vertex under FLP

- Proposition C (NoCut is nowhere dense under FLP; =D even). For even D≥4, in any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,=D}, the set NoCut={graphs without a cut vertex} is nowhere dense.
  Proof. Let O⊇W(M). Insert a finite pinned gadget S with all vertices degree D within S except one vertex x with degree D−2. Explicit S: start from K_{D,D} with bipartition A∪B; pick x∈A, y₁,y₂∈B. Remove edges x−y₁,x−y₂; add edge y₁−y₂. Degrees: deg_S(x)=D−2; all other vertices degree D; S connected. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods of all vertices of S and place S far from existing marks. In any D-regular completion, only x can accept external edges, and exactly two are needed. Thus all cross edges are incident to x; removing x separates S\{x} from the rest, so x is a cut vertex. Therefore O contains an open subset disjoint from NoCut. Hence NoCut is nowhere dense.

4) Beyond FLP: a topological no-go scheme via finite pinning

- Definition (FPP: finite pinning property). A topology τ on X has FPP if for every nonempty open O and some x∈O, there exists an FLP-cylinder W(M) with x∈W(M)⊆O.
- Proposition D (BrFree nowhere dense under FPP; ≤D and =D odd). If τ has FPP, then the proofs of Theorem B and Corollary B1 go through verbatim, hence BrFree is nowhere dense. Similarly, for even D regular, NoCut is nowhere dense.
  Use: This extends the no-go to any “reasonable” topology with finite pinning subbasis; typicality cannot flip there.

5) Coarser, root-insensitive topology and density phenomena

- Define τ_any on Y as the quotient topology from (X,τ_•) via π, equivalently generated by U_F^Y. Then π is open and continuous; τ_any is coarser than τ_• (on X via pullback) and root-insensitive.
- Lemma E (Density of 1-way infinite bridges in τ_any; ≤D). For any nonempty U_F^Y, construct a completion containing F and attach an infinite ray R to some interior vertex u by a single edge e, respecting degree ≤D (choose u with spare capacity or pre-insert a bounded-degree buffer inside the copy of F). The resulting graph lies in U_F^Y and has a 1-way infinite bridge e. Hence {G: has a 1-way infinite bridge} is dense in (Y,τ_any).
- Heuristic (bridgeless density). In many cases, preserving F and completing the graph to be 2-edge-connected away from the pinned finite region is also possible, suggesting bridgeless graphs may be dense as well. If (Y,τ_any) were Baire, disjoint density would preclude either being comeagre, ruling out “bridgeless typical” in τ_any. However, T₁/Baire status of τ_any is subtle: π^{-1}({G}) need not be closed in X, so τ_any may fail T₁, complicating category analysis.

6) Examples/checks

- Odd D=3, seed S instance. K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w₁,w₂. Remove xa, xb, and w₁w₂. Degrees: deg(x)=2=D−1, others 3. Pinning S as above forces exactly one cross edge at x in any 3-regular completion, hence a bridge.
- Even D=4, cut gadget. K_{4,4} with parts A,B; pick x∈A,y₁,y₂∈B. Remove x−y₁, x−y₂ and add y₁−y₂. Degrees: deg(x)=2=D−2, others 4. Only x has external capacity; removing x disconnects, so x is a cut vertex in any 4-regular completion.

7) Obstacles and clarifications

- Saturation caveat. Saturating a nowhere dense set in X under re-rooting can produce a dense meagre set; thus π-based arguments (Propositions A1–A2) are essential for root-invariance.
- τ_any Baire status. Though τ_any is the quotient of compact (X,τ_•), quotient need not be Hausdorff/T₁; Baire property is unsettled here. Any claim about typicality in τ_any must await a structural analysis (T₁/T₀, Baire, possibly quasi-Polish).

8) Next steps (concrete tasks)

- Write up full proofs of Propositions A1–A2 and Lemma A3 in proofs.md (this settles Conjecture 1 for all BP properties).
- Add detailed proof of Theorem B (odd D) and Proposition C (even D) with the explicit seeds S into proofs.md, stating the pinning precisely (radius-1 neighborhoods of S vertices) and the degree-capacity argument in =D spaces.
- Formalize FPP and record Proposition D to broaden the no-go region for Conjecture 2.
- Analyze τ_any: establish separation axioms, and attempt to prove Baire or quasi-Polish. If Baire and both BrFree and “has 1-way infinite bridge” are dense, conclude neither is typical in τ_any.
- For even D-regular, mirror the FLP no-go to the “no cut vertex” property in more general topologies with FPP; document the precise gadget and argument.

Why these are useful

- The corrected odd-D gadget plugs a key gap and yields robust “no-go” for making bridgeless typical across a wide class of local metrics/topologies.
- The π-transfer resolves Conjecture 1 for all natural (BP) properties cleanly and generally.
- The even-D cut-vertex gadget extends typicality obstruction to the regular even case, aligning with Theorem 15 and transferring to FLP/FPP settings.
- The τ_any density result identifies a promising coarser regime where behavior changes, focusing future work on its Baire status to settle Conjecture 2 in either direction.
