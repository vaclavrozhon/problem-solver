  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Strengthen Conjecture 1: prove meagreness is root\u2011invariant without any definability/Baire\u2011property hypotheses on P, using the forgetful map \u03c0 from rooted to unrooted spaces and the fact that \u03c0 is an open, continuous surjection (quotient map). This upgrades the prior \u201cBaire\u2011property\u201d assumption to a full equivalence for all A\u2286Y.\n- Fix the even\u2011D D\u2011regular gadget. Give an explicit finite extension forcing \u03b4=2 with both units of deficit concentrated at the root; in any D\u2011regular completion this makes the root a cut vertex. This repairs the gap flagged in the feedback.\n- For Conjecture 2, formalize a coarser \u201ctail\u201d topology and show that both \u201chas a bridge\u201d and \u201cis bridgeless\u201d have nonempty interior there. If the tail space is Baire, neither set is comeagre, hence bridgeless cannot be typical in that topology.\n\nRoot\u2192unroot quotient and full root\u2011invariance (Conjecture 1)\n\nLet X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} with the BS topology and Y the space of unrooted, connected, countable graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) endowed with the rootless\u2011local topology generated by sets U_F^Y={G\u2208Y: \u2203v B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y be \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma A (\u03c0 is open quotient). \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective and Y carries the quotient topology: U\u2286Y is open iff \u03c0^{-1}(U) is open in X.\nProof. For any rooted r\u2011ball F, \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{v} \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{(F,v)} is open; openness of \u03c0 follows since every open in X is a union of cylinders whose images are rootless cylinders; surjectivity is clear.\n\nLemma B (closure transport). For all A\u2286Y, \u03c0^{-1}(\\overline{A}^Y)=\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X.\nProof. Standard for quotient maps: C\u2286Y is closed iff \u03c0^{-1}(C) is closed; intersect over closed C\u2287A.\n\nTheorem C (nowhere\u2011dense equivalence). For all A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. If A is nowhere dense, then int_Y(\\overline{A}^Y)=\u2205; if U\u2286X is nonempty open contained in \\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X, then \u03c0(U) is nonempty open (Lemma A) and by Lemma B \u03c0(U)\u2286\\overline{A}^Y, contradiction. The converse is symmetric.\n\nTheorem D (meagreness equivalence for all A). For all A\u2286Y, A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Preimages preserve meagreness since they preserve nowhere denseness (Theorem C). (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then \u2203 nonempty open V\u2286Y such that A\u2229V is comeagre in V. Since V\\(A\u2229V) is meagre in V, we can write V\\(A\u2229V)\u2286\u22c3 (N_n\u2229V) with N_n nowhere dense in Y. Then in the subspace \u03c0^{-1}(V), \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) are nowhere dense: indeed cl_{\u03c0^{-1}(V)}(\u03c0^{-1}(N_n)) = cl_X(\u03c0^{-1}(N_n))\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V) = \u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y(N_n))\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V), whose interior in \u03c0^{-1}(V) is empty because int_Y(cl_Y(N_n))=\u2205 by nowhere denseness and \u03c0 is open/quotient as in Theorem C. Hence \u03c0^{-1}(A\u2229V)=\u03c0^{-1}(V)\\\u22c3 \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradicting that \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre.\n\nConsequences. Conjecture 1 holds in full generality: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense/meagre in X iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense/meagre in Y. This covers all properties in Theorems 14\u201317 and beyond.\n\nA corrected even\u2011D D\u2011regular cut\u2011vertex forcing gadget\n\nWe work in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with even D\u22654.\n\nNotation. For a finite rooted ball F with boundary L, let f_F(v)=D\u2212deg_F(v) for v\u2208L and \u03b4(F)=\u03a3_{v\u2208L} f_F(v).\n\nLemma E (finite degree\u2011completion preserving a core). Let D\u22652 and H be a finite simple graph with max degree \u2264D. Let t:V(H)\u2192{0,1,\u2026,D} satisfy deg_H(v)\u2264t(v)\u2264D. Then there exists a finite simple graph J\u2287H (H induced in J) with deg_J(v)=t(v) for v\u2208V(H) and deg_J(u)\u2264D for u\u2208V(J)\\V(H).\nSketch. Let s(v)=t(v)\u2212deg_H(v) be the required increments on old vertices and S=\u03a3_v s(v). Choose T\u226bS,D with T even. Add T new vertices W. Injectively assign to each old vertex v a set A_v\u2286W of size s(v) so that no new vertex is assigned by more than one old vertex (possible since T\u226bS). Put edges between v and all w\u2208A_v. Each new vertex w now has preliminary degree 0 or 1 to old vertices; choose a D\u2032\u2208{D,D\u22121} with \u03a3_w D\u2032\u2212deg(w) even, and fill the remaining degrees on W by adding a simple graph on W of degree sequence d_w\u2208[0,D] so that each w achieves total degree exactly D (Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai criterion can be met for large T). Then H is induced; old vertices hit target degrees t(v); new vertices have degree \u2264D.\n\nProposition F (forcing a cut vertex at the root in even D). Fix even D\u22654. Given any rooted r\u2011ball F in a D\u2011regular graph, there exists r\u2032 and an extension F* with the following properties:\n- All vertices in F* other than the root \u03c1 have degree D within F* (hence f_{F*}(v)=0 for all boundary vertices v\u2260\u03c1).\n- The root \u03c1 has degree D\u22122 within F* (hence f_{F*}(\u03c1)=2), so \u03b4(F*)=2 and all deficit is concentrated at \u03c1.\nConsequently, in any D\u2011regular (infinite) extension G of F*, both cross edges leaving F* are incident to \u03c1, and \u03c1 is a cut vertex of G.\nProof. Starting from F, enlarge within finitely many steps to a finite subgraph H containing the r\u2011ball such that deg_H(\u03c1)=D\u22122 and deg_H(u)\u2264D for all u\u2260\u03c1, while keeping H induced on its vertex set (achieved by adding new vertices and edges only incident to boundary vertices other than \u03c1). Now apply Lemma E with target degrees t(\u03c1)=D\u22122 and t(u)=D for u\u2260\u03c1 to obtain J with H induced and all non\u2011root vertices saturated to degree D within J. Let F* be the rooted ball of J of sufficiently large radius to encompass H (no harm if some vertices of J lie exactly on the boundary). Then f_{F*}(\u03c1)=2 and all other boundary deficits vanish. In any D\u2011regular extension G of F*, the number of cross edges equals \u03b4(F*)=2, and since all other boundary vertices have no deficit, both cross edges must be incident to \u03c1. Removing \u03c1 disconnects the finite set V(F*)\\{\u03c1} from the rest of G, so \u03c1 is a cut vertex.\n\nThis yields an explicit finite refinement forcing a cut vertex, closing the even\u2011D case robustly (and aligning with Theorem 15).\n\nOdd\u2011D parity gadget (recap, with a compact proof)\n\nFor odd D, let Q_D be K_{D+1}\u2212e with deficit vertices a,b. Pairwise deficit reduction via identifying a,b with two boundary vertices decreases \u03b4 by 2 without creating new deficits (all new vertices are D\u2011regular). Iterating yields \u03b4=1 (odd parity forces a minimum of 1), and then the unique cross edge exists in every D\u2011regular extension, hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge is forced. This justifies the odd\u2011D case used in Theorem 14(ii).\n\nConjecture 2: a coarser tail topology and a non\u2011typicality obstruction\n\nDefine the tail topology \u03c4_tail on X by the base\nU_R(G,\u03c1) = { (H,\u03c3): \u2203 root\u2011preserving isomorphism \u03c6: G\\B_R(G,\u03c1) \u2192 H\\B_R(H,\u03c3) mapping \u2202B_R(G,\u03c1) to \u2202B_R(H,\u03c3) }.\nIntuitively, U_R(G,\u03c1) fixes the \u201coutside\u201d beyond radius R up to a boundary identification, while allowing arbitrary changes inside the ball.\n\nObservation G (both bridgeful and bridgeless have nonempty interior in \u03c4_tail). If G has a bridge e outside B_R(G,\u03c1), then U_R(G,\u03c1)\u2286{bridgeful}. Conversely, there exist graphs G with no bridge outside B_R(G,\u03c1) (e.g., any 2\u2011edge\u2011connected graph with large girth seen from \u03c1), yielding U_R(G,\u03c1)\u2286{bridgeless}. Hence both sets have nonempty interior in \u03c4_tail.\nProof. Immediate from the definition: the outside structure (where the certificate edge lies, or the 2\u2011edge\u2011connectivity holds) is fixed throughout U_R(G,\u03c1).\n\nCorollary H (conditional non\u2011typicality under \u03c4_tail). If (X,\u03c4_tail) is a Baire space, then neither the bridgeful set nor the bridgeless set is comeagre. In particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical in \u03c4_tail.\nProof. In a Baire space, a comeagre set must be dense; but both sets have disjoint nonempty open subsets by Observation G, so neither is dense.\n\nExamples\n\n- Odd D=3 gadget: Starting with any rooted cylinder F in 3\u2011regular graphs, iterative Q_3=K_4\u2212e attachments reduce \u03b4 to 1; any extension has exactly one cross edge, which is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\n- Even D=4 cut\u2011vertex: From any F, enlarge to F* with deg_{F*}(\u03c1)=2 and all other boundary vertices saturated to degree 4. In any 4\u2011regular extension, the only cross edges are two edges at \u03c1, so \u03c1 is a cut vertex.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Tail topology \u03c4_tail: establishing its Baire (or Polish) status remains open; without this, Corollary H is conditional. Identifying \u03c4_tail as an inverse limit of compact spaces (or a continuous open image of a compact) would settle Baire\u2011ness.\n- Alternative topologies: Designing a Baire, non\u2011cylinder\u2011based metric where bridgeless becomes comeagre seems unlikely in light of Observation G\u2011style obstructions; formalizing a broad no\u2011go theorem requires a general criterion on topologies where \u201coutside fixing\u201d creates clopen obstructions.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Add Lemmas A\u2013B, Theorems C\u2013D to proofs.md, fully settling Conjecture 1 (meagreness and nowhere\u2011denseness root\u2011invariant for all P).\n- Insert Proposition F (even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing) with Lemma E into proofs.md; this also strengthens the no\u2011go zone for Conjecture 2 across any topology admitting rooted cylinders as neighborhoods.\n- Analyze \u03c4_tail rigorously: characterize basic compact quotients by \u201coutside beyond R,\u201d prove Baire property (or find a counterexample). If Baire, Corollary H rules out bridgeless typicality there.\n- Explore an \u201coccurrence\u2011from\u2011root\u201d coarser pseudometric d_occ by comparing the sets {B_r(G,v): dist(\u03c1,v)\u2264r}; determine whether its Kolmogorov quotient is Baire and whether bridgeful/bridgeless both have nonempty interior, yielding another negative instance for Conjecture 2.\n"
