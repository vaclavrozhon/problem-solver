Ideas

- Strengthen Conjecture 1: prove meagreness is root‑invariant without any definability/Baire‑property hypotheses on P, using the forgetful map π from rooted to unrooted spaces and the fact that π is an open, continuous surjection (quotient map). This upgrades the prior “Baire‑property” assumption to a full equivalence for all A⊆Y.
- Fix the even‑D D‑regular gadget. Give an explicit finite extension forcing δ=2 with both units of deficit concentrated at the root; in any D‑regular completion this makes the root a cut vertex. This repairs the gap flagged in the feedback.
- For Conjecture 2, formalize a coarser “tail” topology and show that both “has a bridge” and “is bridgeless” have nonempty interior there. If the tail space is Baire, neither set is comeagre, hence bridgeless cannot be typical in that topology.

Root→unroot quotient and full root‑invariance (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the BS topology and Y the space of unrooted, connected, countable graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) endowed with the rootless‑local topology generated by sets U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v B_r(G,v)≅F}. Let π:X→Y be π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma A (π is open quotient). π is continuous, open, surjective and Y carries the quotient topology: U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open in X.
Proof. For any rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v} \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{(F,v)} is open; openness of π follows since every open in X is a union of cylinders whose images are rootless cylinders; surjectivity is clear.

Lemma B (closure transport). For all A⊆Y, π^{-1}(\overline{A}^Y)=\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X.
Proof. Standard for quotient maps: C⊆Y is closed iff π^{-1}(C) is closed; intersect over closed C⊇A.

Theorem C (nowhere‑dense equivalence). For all A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. If A is nowhere dense, then int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)=∅; if U⊆X is nonempty open contained in \overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X, then π(U) is nonempty open (Lemma A) and by Lemma B π(U)⊆\overline{A}^Y, contradiction. The converse is symmetric.

Theorem D (meagreness equivalence for all A). For all A⊆Y, A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages preserve meagreness since they preserve nowhere denseness (Theorem C). (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y such that A∩V is comeagre in V. Since V\(A∩V) is meagre in V, we can write V\(A∩V)⊆⋃ (N_n∩V) with N_n nowhere dense in Y. Then in the subspace π^{-1}(V), π^{-1}(N_n) are nowhere dense: indeed cl_{π^{-1}(V)}(π^{-1}(N_n)) = cl_X(π^{-1}(N_n))∩π^{-1}(V) = π^{-1}(cl_Y(N_n))∩π^{-1}(V), whose interior in π^{-1}(V) is empty because int_Y(cl_Y(N_n))=∅ by nowhere denseness and π is open/quotient as in Theorem C. Hence π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(V)\⋃ π^{-1}(N_n) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), contradicting that π^{-1}(A) is meagre.

Consequences. Conjecture 1 holds in full generality: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense/meagre in X iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense/meagre in Y. This covers all properties in Theorems 14–17 and beyond.

A corrected even‑D D‑regular cut‑vertex forcing gadget

We work in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4.

Notation. For a finite rooted ball F with boundary L, let f_F(v)=D−deg_F(v) for v∈L and δ(F)=Σ_{v∈L} f_F(v).

Lemma E (finite degree‑completion preserving a core). Let D≥2 and H be a finite simple graph with max degree ≤D. Let t:V(H)→{0,1,…,D} satisfy deg_H(v)≤t(v)≤D. Then there exists a finite simple graph J⊇H (H induced in J) with deg_J(v)=t(v) for v∈V(H) and deg_J(u)≤D for u∈V(J)\V(H).
Sketch. Let s(v)=t(v)−deg_H(v) be the required increments on old vertices and S=Σ_v s(v). Choose T≫S,D with T even. Add T new vertices W. Injectively assign to each old vertex v a set A_v⊆W of size s(v) so that no new vertex is assigned by more than one old vertex (possible since T≫S). Put edges between v and all w∈A_v. Each new vertex w now has preliminary degree 0 or 1 to old vertices; choose a D′∈{D,D−1} with Σ_w D′−deg(w) even, and fill the remaining degrees on W by adding a simple graph on W of degree sequence d_w∈[0,D] so that each w achieves total degree exactly D (Erdős–Gallai criterion can be met for large T). Then H is induced; old vertices hit target degrees t(v); new vertices have degree ≤D.

Proposition F (forcing a cut vertex at the root in even D). Fix even D≥4. Given any rooted r‑ball F in a D‑regular graph, there exists r′ and an extension F* with the following properties:
- All vertices in F* other than the root ρ have degree D within F* (hence f_{F*}(v)=0 for all boundary vertices v≠ρ).
- The root ρ has degree D−2 within F* (hence f_{F*}(ρ)=2), so δ(F*)=2 and all deficit is concentrated at ρ.
Consequently, in any D‑regular (infinite) extension G of F*, both cross edges leaving F* are incident to ρ, and ρ is a cut vertex of G.
Proof. Starting from F, enlarge within finitely many steps to a finite subgraph H containing the r‑ball such that deg_H(ρ)=D−2 and deg_H(u)≤D for all u≠ρ, while keeping H induced on its vertex set (achieved by adding new vertices and edges only incident to boundary vertices other than ρ). Now apply Lemma E with target degrees t(ρ)=D−2 and t(u)=D for u≠ρ to obtain J with H induced and all non‑root vertices saturated to degree D within J. Let F* be the rooted ball of J of sufficiently large radius to encompass H (no harm if some vertices of J lie exactly on the boundary). Then f_{F*}(ρ)=2 and all other boundary deficits vanish. In any D‑regular extension G of F*, the number of cross edges equals δ(F*)=2, and since all other boundary vertices have no deficit, both cross edges must be incident to ρ. Removing ρ disconnects the finite set V(F*)\{ρ} from the rest of G, so ρ is a cut vertex.

This yields an explicit finite refinement forcing a cut vertex, closing the even‑D case robustly (and aligning with Theorem 15).

Odd‑D parity gadget (recap, with a compact proof)

For odd D, let Q_D be K_{D+1}−e with deficit vertices a,b. Pairwise deficit reduction via identifying a,b with two boundary vertices decreases δ by 2 without creating new deficits (all new vertices are D‑regular). Iterating yields δ=1 (odd parity forces a minimum of 1), and then the unique cross edge exists in every D‑regular extension, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge is forced. This justifies the odd‑D case used in Theorem 14(ii).

Conjecture 2: a coarser tail topology and a non‑typicality obstruction

Define the tail topology τ_tail on X by the base
U_R(G,ρ) = { (H,σ): ∃ root‑preserving isomorphism φ: G\B_R(G,ρ) → H\B_R(H,σ) mapping ∂B_R(G,ρ) to ∂B_R(H,σ) }.
Intuitively, U_R(G,ρ) fixes the “outside” beyond radius R up to a boundary identification, while allowing arbitrary changes inside the ball.

Observation G (both bridgeful and bridgeless have nonempty interior in τ_tail). If G has a bridge e outside B_R(G,ρ), then U_R(G,ρ)⊆{bridgeful}. Conversely, there exist graphs G with no bridge outside B_R(G,ρ) (e.g., any 2‑edge‑connected graph with large girth seen from ρ), yielding U_R(G,ρ)⊆{bridgeless}. Hence both sets have nonempty interior in τ_tail.
Proof. Immediate from the definition: the outside structure (where the certificate edge lies, or the 2‑edge‑connectivity holds) is fixed throughout U_R(G,ρ).

Corollary H (conditional non‑typicality under τ_tail). If (X,τ_tail) is a Baire space, then neither the bridgeful set nor the bridgeless set is comeagre. In particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical in τ_tail.
Proof. In a Baire space, a comeagre set must be dense; but both sets have disjoint nonempty open subsets by Observation G, so neither is dense.

Examples

- Odd D=3 gadget: Starting with any rooted cylinder F in 3‑regular graphs, iterative Q_3=K_4−e attachments reduce δ to 1; any extension has exactly one cross edge, which is a 1‑way infinite bridge.
- Even D=4 cut‑vertex: From any F, enlarge to F* with deg_{F*}(ρ)=2 and all other boundary vertices saturated to degree 4. In any 4‑regular extension, the only cross edges are two edges at ρ, so ρ is a cut vertex.

Obstacles

- Tail topology τ_tail: establishing its Baire (or Polish) status remains open; without this, Corollary H is conditional. Identifying τ_tail as an inverse limit of compact spaces (or a continuous open image of a compact) would settle Baire‑ness.
- Alternative topologies: Designing a Baire, non‑cylinder‑based metric where bridgeless becomes comeagre seems unlikely in light of Observation G‑style obstructions; formalizing a broad no‑go theorem requires a general criterion on topologies where “outside fixing” creates clopen obstructions.

Next steps

- Add Lemmas A–B, Theorems C–D to proofs.md, fully settling Conjecture 1 (meagreness and nowhere‑denseness root‑invariant for all P).
- Insert Proposition F (even‑D cut‑vertex forcing) with Lemma E into proofs.md; this also strengthens the no‑go zone for Conjecture 2 across any topology admitting rooted cylinders as neighborhoods.
- Analyze τ_tail rigorously: characterize basic compact quotients by “outside beyond R,” prove Baire property (or find a counterexample). If Baire, Corollary H rules out bridgeless typicality there.
- Explore an “occurrence‑from‑root” coarser pseudometric d_occ by comparing the sets {B_r(G,v): dist(ρ,v)≤r}; determine whether its Kolmogorov quotient is Baire and whether bridgeful/bridgeless both have nonempty interior, yielding another negative instance for Conjecture 2.
