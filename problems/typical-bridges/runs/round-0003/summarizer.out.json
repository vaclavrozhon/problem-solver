  "summary_md": "Last round: Conjecture 1 was resolved. Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved A\u2286Y is nowhere dense iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence Borel/analytic properties). Conjecture 2: cylinder\u2011based metric changes cannot alter typicality\u2014any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense there. Explicit gadgets were constructed: an odd\u2011D parity refinement forcing S(F')=1 (hence a unique outgoing edge \u2192 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every D\u2011regular completion) and an even\u2011D refinement forcing a root of degree D\u22122 (hence a cut vertex). A coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) was proposed in which 1\u2011way\u2011bridge graphs are dense; its Baire/Polish status and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets remain open.

  "highlights": [
    "Conjecture 1 settled: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space \u21d4 its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets.",
    "Key tool: forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y is continuous, open and surjective, enabling category transfer between rooted and unrooted spaces.",
    "No\u2011go: any topology whose base is rooted cylinders equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so cylinder\u2011based metric variants cannot change typicality.",
    "Odd\u2011D parity gadget: constructed F\u2032 with S(F\u2032)=1, forcing a single outgoing edge and thus a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every D\u2011regular completion.",
    "Even\u2011D gadget: refined cylinder forcing a designated vertex of degree D\u22122 so that in every D\u2011regular completion that vertex is a cut vertex.",
    "Coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) changes density behaviour (1\u2011way bridges dense), but its Baire/Polish status and typicality consequences are unresolved."

  "next_questions": [
    "Formalize the d_any topology precisely, prove or disprove it is a Baire (or Polish) space, and classify the category of \u2018bridgeless\u2019 and \u2018has a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u2019 there.",
    "Finalize and polish the \u03c0\u2011based proofs and the parity/cut\u2011vertex gadget constructions for inclusion in proofs.md (fill remaining formal details).",
    "Verify section/choice metrics (bounded re\u2011rooting equivalence) for corner cases and confirm no other natural cylinder\u2011based variants were missed."
