Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved A\u2286Y is nowhere dense iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence Borel/analytic properties). Conjecture 2: cylinder\u2011based metric changes cannot alter typicality\u2014any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense there. Explicit gadgets were constructed: an odd\u2011D parity refinement forcing S(F')=1 (hence a unique outgoing edge \u2192 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every D\u2011regular completion) and an even\u2011D refinement forcing a root of degree D\u22122 (hence a cut vertex). A coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) was proposed in which 1\u2011way\u2011bridge graphs are dense; its Baire/Polish status and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets remain open.
