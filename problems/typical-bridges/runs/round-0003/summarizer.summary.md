Last round: Conjecture 1 was resolved. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved A⊆Y is nowhere dense iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence Borel/analytic properties). Conjecture 2: cylinder‑based metric changes cannot alter typicality—any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense there. Explicit gadgets were constructed: an odd‑D parity refinement forcing S(F')=1 (hence a unique outgoing edge → 1‑way infinite bridge in every D‑regular completion) and an even‑D refinement forcing a root of degree D−2 (hence a cut vertex). A coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) was proposed in which 1‑way‑bridge graphs are dense; its Baire/Polish status and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets remain open.
