  "feedback_md": "Good progress consolidating Conjecture 1 via the forgetful map \u03c0 and tightening the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d region for Conjecture 2. Main points:\n\n- Conjecture 1: The \u03c0\u2011framework is correct. \u03c0:X\u2192Y (rooted\u2192unrooted) is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere\u2011denseness transfers equivalently; meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property. Provers 1\u20133 gave clean arguments; Prover 3 also correctly shows Y is Baire since \u03c0 is an open continuous surjection from the Baire space X. Caution: Prover 5\u2019s claim of meagreness equivalence for all A\u2286Y (no Baire\u2011property assumption) is not justified; the key step \u201cA non\u2011meagre \u21d2 \u2203 open V with A\u2229V comeagre\u201d may fail without the Baire property. Please retract/limit to Baire\u2011property (e.g., Borel/analytic) sets.\n\n- Conjecture 2 (cylinder/finite\u2011lens topologies): The arguments that typicality is preserved under any topology with rooted cylinders as a base are sound. Prover 4\u2019s FLP framework is a useful generalization. Earlier parity/regularity flaws have been fixed: the odd\u2011D bridge\u2011forcing gadgets (either the \u03b4(F\u2032)=1 parity count or a pinned K_{D+2}\u2011based seed) are now correct, provided we pin all radius\u20111 neighborhoods so nonterminal vertices are saturated at degree D.\n\n- Even\u2011D regular case: Several acceptable constructions now force a cut vertex by concentrating all deficit at a single vertex (root), with all other vertices saturated. Prover 4\u2019s K_{D,D} edit and Prover 5\u2019s degree\u2011completion lemma both lead to a rigorous cylinder refinement implying \u201cno cut\u2011vertex\u201d is nowhere dense. We add a precise proof in proofs.md.\n\n- Coarser topologies: d_any/occurrence/tail ideas are promising. The density of 1\u2011way (and 2\u2011way) infinite bridges is well\u2011argued under root\u2011insensitive proximities; bridgeless density is also plausible (and proved for D\u22654 in Y). Do not claim compact/Polish/Baire without proof; Prover 3\u2019s Baire proof for Y via \u03c0 is solid, but for alternative topologies we still lack such results. The tail topology observation that both bridgeful and bridgeless can have nonempty interior is useful, but typicality conclusions remain conditional on Baire\u2011ness.\n\nNext steps:\n- Finalize \u03c0\u2011based proofs (ND equivalence; meagreness for BP sets) in proofs.md; avoid non\u2011BP claims.\n- Record a complete, layer\u2011respecting odd\u2011D \u03b4=1 gadget proof (done) and add a full even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing cylinder (added here).\n- For a chosen coarser topology (d_any or occurrence), define a complete metric/topology precisely and prove (or refute) Baire\u2011ness; then decide whether bridgeless/bridgeful are meagre/comeagre.\n- For D=3 in Y, complete the bridgeless density construction or bound it sharply.",

For Conjecture 2, robust \u201cno\u2011go\u201d holds across cylinder/finite\u2011lens topologies; an explicit odd\u2011D bridge\u2011forcing cylinder (\u03b4=1) and an even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing cylinder are now rigorous.

    "content": "Update \u2014 Root-invariance finalized; even-D cut-vertex forcing\n\n- Conjecture 1: We adopt the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (rooted\u2192unrooted). \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective. For any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. For sets A with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Thus smallness/meagreness of S_P is root-invariant for all natural properties considered. Note: without the Baire property, meagreness transfer need not hold; we avoid such claims.\n\n- Odd D-regular (bridge forcing): We keep the \u03b4(F\u2032)=1 parity construction: extend an r-ball F by one layer W, choose t and e_W so that every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F\u2032)=1. Then any D-regular completion has exactly one cross edge\u2014a 1-way infinite bridge.\n\n- Even D-regular (cut vertex forcing): We can refine any cylinder to pin a finite gadget so that all vertices except a designated vertex u have degree D within the refined ball, while deg(u)=D\u22122. Consequently, in any D-regular completion all cross edges attach to u, making u a cut vertex. One explicit seed: start from K_{D,D}, pick x\u2208A, y1,y2\u2208B, delete x\u2212y1 and x\u2212y2, add y1\u2212y2; pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Embedding this seed outward in the ball yields the desired refinement.\n\n- Coarser topologies: For root-insensitive topologies (e.g., d_any/occurrence), graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; bridgeless graphs often are too (proved for D\u22654 in Y). Baire/Polish status of these topologies remains the key open point to conclude typicality there."

    "content": "Proposition (Even-D regular cut-vertex forcing cylinder).\nLet D\u22654 be even. In the space \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}, for any rooted r-ball F that occurs in a D-regular graph, there exists R\u2265r and a rooted refinement F^{\\ast} with the following properties:\n(i) every vertex at distance < R from the root in F^{\\ast} has degree D within F^{\\ast}, except the root \u03c1 which has degree D\u22122;\n(ii) F^{\\ast} is realizable as a rooted R-ball in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D};\n(iii) for any D-regular extension G of F^{\\ast}, the vertex \u03c1 is a cut vertex of G.\n\nProof.\nStarting from F=B_r(G,\u03c1), we build a finite connected graph H extending F outward so that degrees inside are controlled and H is the rooted ball of some radius R. First, saturate all vertices at distances \u2264 r to degree D by attaching new vertices at distance r+1 (respecting degree \u2264 D). Choose R large enough so new attachments lie within distance < R, and repeat saturation layer by layer up to distance R\u22121, except at the root \u03c1 where we target degree D\u22122. This yields a finite induced subgraph K with deg_K(v)=D for all v\u2260\u03c1 and deg_K(\u03c1)=D\u22122, and all vertices of K are at distance < R from \u03c1 (no edges are added within the boundary layer so the ball structure is preserved). Set F^{\\ast} to be the rooted R-ball induced by K.\n\nWe must argue realizability (ii) while keeping degree caps. Consider K as a finite simple graph with max degree \u2264 D, with target degrees t(v)=D for v\u2260\u03c1 and t(\u03c1)=D\u22122. By a finite degree-completion lemma (Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai type), there exists a finite simple graph J \u2287 K, with K induced in J, such that deg_J(v)=t(v) for v\u2208V(K) and deg_J(u)\u2264 D for u\u2208V(J)\\V(K). Concretely, add a large finite set W of new vertices and connect each v\u2208V(K) to exactly t(v)\u2212deg_K(v) distinct vertices of W; then complete the remaining degrees within W by adding a simple D-bounded graph on W. Finally, attach to J any infinite D-regular completion outside the sphere S_R leaving the R-ball unchanged. Thus F^{\\ast} occurs in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}.\n\nFor (iii), in any D-regular extension G of F^{\\ast}, all vertices other than \u03c1 are saturated to degree D inside B_R(G,\u03c1), so no cross edge can be incident to them. Since deg_{B_R}(\u03c1)=D\u22122, exactly two cross edges leave B_R and both are incident to \u03c1. Hence G\u2212\u03c1 disconnects: one component is the finite interior B_R\\{\u03c1}, another is the (nonempty) exterior part, so \u03c1 is a cut vertex. \u220e"
