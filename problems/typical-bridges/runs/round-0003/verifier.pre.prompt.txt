# Open Problem: Resolve the Final Two Conjectures on Typical Properties of Countable Graphs

This note poses two conjectures extracted from the extended abstract **“Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges (extended abstract)”** by Robert Šámal and Hadi Zamani (EUROCOMB’25). We first state the setting precisely and then formulate the conjectures. The authors’ extended abstract (lightly re‑typeset) follows afterward for context.

---

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

---

## Conjectures

### Conjecture 1 — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

### Conjecture 2 — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

---

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

---

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

---

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.

# Research Notes



Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2

1) Root-invariance (Conjecture 1)
- Spaces: X = G_{\bullet,D} (rooted local topology), Y = unrooted countable connected graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v with B_r(G,v) ≅ F}.
- Forgetful map π: X → Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open, surjective.
- Consequences:
  • Nowhere denseness transfers: A⊆Y is nowhere dense ⇔ π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
  • Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic): A meagre in Y ⇔ π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
  • Hence for any natural property P of unrooted graphs (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.), the smallness/meagreness status of S_P in X is root-invariant.
- Alternative restatement (root-free ND test): For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense ⇔ for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}.
- Caution: Saturating a nowhere dense set need not remain nowhere dense (can become dense meagre). Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.

2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2
- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.
- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.

3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2
- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.
- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.

4) Section metrics on unrooted space
- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show ‘bridgeless’ remains nowhere dense for every section metric.

5) Action items
- Move π-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.
- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.
- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.
- For ‘2-way infinite bridge’ across section metrics, fill in the ‘not nowhere dense’ part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.


Addendum — Odd-D regular bridge gadget and coarser topologies

- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r′-ball F′ with S(F′)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.
- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.

# Main Results



Main interim results toward the conjectures

- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):
  • Nowhere-dense part resolved. For any property P of unrooted graphs, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space iff the corresponding set T_P in the unrooted space is nowhere dense. This uses the forgetful map π (continuous, open, surjective) and yields a root-free cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets.
  • Meagre part resolved for all properties with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic P): S_P is meagre in the rooted space iff T_P is meagre in the unrooted space. Hence smallness is root-invariant for all natural properties considered (bridges, cut vertices, edge-colouring constraints, etc.).

- Metric sensitivity (Conjecture 2):
  • No-go: Any metric that induces the same cylinder (Benjamini–Schramm) topology preserves typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics.
  • Coarser “rootless-local” proximity: For a natural re-rooting–insensitive closeness, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, indicating genuinely different behavior once the topology is coarsened. The Baire status and typicality under such a topology remain open.



=== Prover 1 Output ===

Ideas

- Strengthen and formalize the root–forgetful map approach to Conjecture 1 (both nowhere‑dense and meagre for Baire‑property sets), with complete, short proofs suitable for proofs.md.
- Establish a robust no‑go theorem for Conjecture 2 across all ball‑local (cylinder‑based) topologies: Theorems 14–17 persist unchanged. Add the “meagre but dense” robustness for 2‑way infinite bridges (Theorem 16) in any such topology.
- Provide a fully explicit parity/counting gadget for odd D to force a unique external edge (hence a 1‑way infinite bridge in any D‑regular completion). This repairs earlier parity issues and pins that the argument is topology‑agnostic within ball‑local classes.
- Give an explicit even D cut‑vertex forcing gadget: a finite D‑bounded r′‑ball F′ in which all deficits are concentrated at a single vertex u with deg_{F′}(u)=D−2 and all other vertices saturated to D. In any D‑regular extension, all external edges must be incident to u, making u a cut vertex.
- For a natural rootless, re‑rooting‑insensitive pseudometric d_any, prove new density lemmas: 2‑way infinite bridges are dense as well (in addition to previously shown 1‑way bridges and bridgeless graphs). This sharpens our picture of Conjecture 2 under genuinely different topologies.

Rigorous results and proofs

A. Root‑invariance (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} (rooted space with BS topology) and Y=\mathbf{G}_{\varnothing,D} (unrooted space with rootless‑local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v with B_r(G,v)≅F} for rooted r‑balls F). Let π:X→Y be π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma A1 (π continuous, open, surjective). For any rooted r‑ball F, π(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F)=U_F^Y and π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F. Hence π is continuous, open, onto.

Lemma A2 (closure/interior commute with π^{-1}). For all A⊆Y,
cl_X π^{-1}(A)=π^{-1}(cl_Y A) and int_X π^{-1}(A)=π^{-1}(int_Y A).
Proof. Continuity gives cl_X π^{-1}(A)⊆π^{-1}(cl_Y A). For the reverse, if x∈π^{-1}(cl_Y A) and U⊂X is open with x∈U, then π(U) is open (π open), π(x)∈cl_Y A ⇒ π(U)∩A≠∅ ⇒ U∩π^{-1}(A)≠∅. Interior identity follows by complementing and reapplying closure identity.

Proposition A3 (nowhere‑dense equivalence). For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. Nowhere dense ⇔ int cl = ∅. Using Lemma A2, int_X cl_X π^{-1}(A) = π^{-1}(int_Y cl_Y A). Surjectivity of π implies the right side is empty iff int_Y cl_Y A is empty.

Proposition A4 (meagre equivalence for sets with the Baire property). Suppose A⊆Y has the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. “⇒” is immediate by A3 and countable unions. For “⇐”: if π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is non‑meagre, then some nonempty open V⊂Y has A comeagre in V. Thus V∖A is meagre, hence π^{-1}(V∖A) meagre by A3. But π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X, so π^{-1}(A) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of π^{-1}(A) in the Baire space X.

Corollary A5 (Conjecture 1). For any unrooted property P and S_P=π^{-1}(T_P), smallness is root‑invariant: S_P nowhere dense (resp. meagre for Baire‑property P) in X iff T_P nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in Y. A root‑free cylinder criterion follows: for saturated S⊂X, S is nowhere dense iff ∀ unrooted balls B ∃ refinement B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S.

B. No‑go for ball‑local topologies (Conjecture 2)

Definition B1. A topology τ on X is ball‑local if {\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F} is a base.

Theorem B2. In any ball‑local topology on X, Theorems 14–17 (bridgeless nowhere dense; cut‑vertex nowhere dense; 2‑way infinite bridges meagre; χ′=D nowhere dense) remain valid. In particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical in any ball‑local topology.
Proof. Each proof proceeds by rooted cylinder refinements that enforce a local obstruction in every extension of a refined ball F′. Such refinements depend only on the extension poset of finite rooted balls, not on metric numerics. Hence the same arguments show nowhere denseness/meagreness in any topology with the same cylinder base.

C. Odd D regular: a compact parity gadget

Define S(F)=∑_{v∈V(F)}(D−deg_F(v)). In any D‑regular completion H⊇F, |δ_H(V(F))|=S(F).

Proposition C1 (S(F′)=1 forcing). Let D be odd ≥3 and F a rooted r‑ball that occurs in a D‑regular graph. There exists an r′ and a rooted refinement F′ with max degree ≤D and S(F′)=1. Consequently, any D‑regular extension of F′ contains a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Proof. Let L be the boundary of F, c=∑_{v∈L}(D−deg_F(v))=S(F). Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1, and connect each v∈L to D−deg_F(v) distinct vertices in W (total c edges). Add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t−c−1)/2 (choose t≥c with t≡c+1 mod 2; D odd ensures integrality). This yields S(F′)=D t−(c+2 e_W)=1. Degree bounds at W are respected by choosing t large and building the needed e_W‑edge simple graph on W. Then every D‑regular completion has exactly one edge leaving V(F′), which is a bridge; the outside component is infinite, hence 1‑way infinite.

D. Even D regular: a cut‑vertex forcing gadget

Proposition D1 (cut vertex forcing for even D). Let D be even, D≥4. For any rooted r‑ball F that occurs in some D‑regular graph, there exists an r′ and a rooted refinement F′ with max degree ≤D and a vertex u∈V(F′) such that: (i) deg_{F′}(u)=D−2 and every other vertex of F′ has degree D; (ii) F′−u has exactly two connected components A,B; (iii) there are no edges between A and B in F′. Consequently, in any D‑regular completion H⊇F′, all edges leaving V(F′) are incident to u, and u is a cut vertex of H.

Proof. Pick any connected D‑regular graph R on D+2 vertices obtained as K_{D+2} minus a perfect matching (exists and is connected). It admits further perfect matchings (since K_{D+2} has a 1‑factorization; removing one perfect matching leaves a union of the remaining 1‑factors). Take two disjoint copies R_A,R_B. Let k=D−2 (even). Choose nonempty disjoint sets V_A⊂V(R_A), V_B⊂V(R_B) with |V_A|+|V_B|=k. For each x∈V_A∪V_B, delete one incident edge x y_x such that the deleted edges are pairwise disjoint (possible by abundance of matchings in dense R_⋅). Collect the freed endpoints W={y_x}. Pair up W inside each copy and add an edge between each pair within that copy (avoiding parallel edges). This restores all degrees in R_A∪R_B to D except at x which are now D−1; add a new vertex u and connect u to each x∈V_A∪V_B. Then deg(u)=k=D−2 and all other vertices have degree D. The resulting graph F* is connected and F*−u has exactly two connected components R_A and R_B. Now let F′ be the (r′)-ball refinement obtained by grafting F* far outside the original boundary L of F and saturating all vertices within distance ≤ r′ from the root so that F′ contains F and F*. Because all vertices except u have degree D in F′, any D‑regular extension H of F′ must add exactly two new edges (since S(F′)=2), both incident to u. No edge can join A and B outside F′ (their vertices are saturated inside F′). Thus removing u disconnects H into (at least) the outside part and the two components containing R_A and R_B, so u is a cut vertex. Degree bounds and simplicity are maintained by the local rewiring and by adding u. (A standard choice is to work inside K_{D+2} minus one 1‑factor to ensure plentiful matchings; removing a small matching and re‑adding a matching preserves connectivity.)

E. Robustness of Theorem 16 in ball‑local topologies

Let T_{2wb} be the set of rooted graphs in X that contain a 2‑way infinite bridge.

Proposition E1 (meagre). For each k∈\mathbb{N}, the set A_k={ (G,ρ): there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at graph distance ≤k from ρ } is nowhere dense in any ball‑local topology; hence T_{2wb}=⋃_k A_k is meagre.
Proof. Fix a rooted r‑ball F and k. Enlarge r if needed so that all edges at distance ≤k from the root lie strictly within B_{r−1}(F). Construct a refinement F′ by locally adding short cycles (triangles/squares or parity gadgets respecting degree constraints) around each edge within distance ≤k so that in any extension each such edge lies on a cycle contained within distance ≤ r from the root. This is possible by attaching bounded‑size 2‑edge‑connected gadgets to the endpoints while keeping max degree ≤D (in =D, use parity gadgets to balance degrees, as in C1). Then every extension of F′ has no bridge at distance ≤k. Therefore \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}⊂\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\A_k, proving A_k is nowhere dense.

Proposition E2 (dense). T_{2wb} is dense in any ball‑local topology on X.
Proof. Given any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, construct a graph G by extending a copy of F outside its boundary by attaching two disjoint infinite bounded‑degree connected graphs S_1,S_2 (e.g., two infinite ladders) and then adding a single edge e between S_1 and S_2. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r+1 so B_r equals F. The edge e is a 2‑way infinite bridge in G. Hence \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F meets T_{2wb}, proving density.

Thus Theorem 16 (meagre but not nowhere dense) persists across all ball‑local topologies.

F. Re‑rooting–insensitive pseudometric d_any: further density

Define on X the symmetric pseudometric
δ(x,y)=2^{−sup{ r: ∃σ B_r(x)≅B_r(y,σ) }} and d_any(x,y)=max{δ(x,y),δ(y,x)}.
Two graphs are close if each contains a large rooted ball occurring somewhere in the other.

Lemma F1 (1‑way infinite bridges dense in ≤D). For any x=(G,ρ) and r, there exists H with a 1‑way infinite bridge and σ∈V(H) such that B_r(H,σ)≅B_r(G,ρ) and d_any(x,(H,σ))≤2^{−r}.
Proof. As previously shown: attach an infinite pendant ray outside the r‑ball at a boundary vertex with available degree and complete the rest at distance ≥ r+1.

Lemma F2 (bridgeless dense in ≤D). For any x and r, there exists bridgeless H and σ with the same r‑ball and d_any≤2^{−r} (attach the r‑ball to a 2‑edge‑connected infinite scaffold and route boundary edges into cycles; see earlier E2‑type construction).

Lemma F3 (2‑way infinite bridges dense in ≤D). For any x and r, there exists H with a 2‑way infinite bridge and σ with B_r(H,σ)≅B_r(G,ρ), hence d_any≤2^{−r}.
Proof. Let F=B_r(G,ρ). Outside the copy of F, attach two disjoint infinite bounded‑degree connected graphs S_1,S_2 and connect them by a single edge e. If some boundary vertex v in F has degree < D, join v by a path of length ≥2 to S_1 to ensure H is connected while keeping degrees ≤D (if none, add a new tree beyond distance r+1 and connect appropriately to respect bounds). Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge. Since attachments are beyond distance r, the r‑ball remains F at σ.

Consequences for Conjecture 2. Under d_any on ≤D, all three classes—bridgeless, 1‑way, and 2‑way infinite bridge graphs—are dense. Determining typicality requires understanding whether the d_any‑quotient is Baire; if it is Baire, none of these dense sets can be comeagre simultaneously. Establishing (non‑)Baireness of the d_any topology is the next critical step.

Obstacles

- Even D cut‑vertex gadget (D1): while the local rewiring scheme is standard in regular graphs (using matchings in dense graphs), one must ensure the chosen deleted edges form a matching and connectivity of each component R_A,R_B is preserved. Working inside K_{D+2} minus one perfect matching ensures abundant matchings; removing a tiny matching and re‑adding a matching preserves connectivity in such dense graphs.
- For E1 (meagreness of near‑root 2‑way bridges), ensuring degree constraints in =D requires parity gadgets akin to C1 to avoid exceeding D; the argument is local and uniform but should be written with an explicit small 2‑edge‑connected gadget for each D.
- For d_any, Baire/Polish status remains open; we avoid any claims here.

Next steps

- Write full proofs of A3–A4 into proofs.md, settling Conjecture 1 for natural (Borel/analytic) properties.
- Expand C1 and D1 into detailed constructions with explicit small gadgets (e.g., instantiate R_A,R_B as K_{D+2} minus a fixed perfect matching; spell out the matching deletions and reconnections; verify connectivity rigorously).
- For E1, fix explicit 2‑edge‑connected gadgets for each D (≤D and =D) to cycle‑protect all edges within a prescribed radius without violating degree bounds.
- Analyze the Baire property of (X/∼,d_any): characterize basic neighborhoods via finite bi‑directional occurrence constraints and attempt a completion procedure; alternatively, embed the image into the Cantor cube via pattern‑occurrence indicators and study the subspace topology.
- Optional: strengthen density by showing that 2‑vertex‑connected graphs are also dense under d_any (construct via attaching to a 3‑edge‑connected scaffold and ensuring two internally disjoint connections from the r‑ball boundary), further separating typical behaviors under d_any.

Ideas

- Finalize Conjecture 1 via the forgetful map π from rooted to unrooted spaces: prove π is continuous, open, and surjective, and transfer nowhere‑denseness and meagreness (for Baire‑property sets). This removes any reliance on “saturation preserves nowhere‑denseness” (false in general).
- Strengthen the “no‑go” for Conjecture 2 in cylinder‑type topologies by completing the odd‑D bridge‑forcing gadget inside a ball and giving an even‑D cut‑vertex forcing gadget, both as cylinder refinements. Add an invariance lemma for section metrics under bounded re‑rootings.
- Propose and analyze a genuinely non‑local, rootless “occurrence topology” 𝒯_occ on unrooted graphs; prove density of both “has a 1‑way infinite bridge” and “bridgeless” therein. Baire status remains to be settled; if Baire and both dense, neither property is typical in 𝒯_occ.

Rigorous statements and proofs

Setup. Let D≥2. Let X:=𝔾_{•,D} be rooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with Δ≤D (or =D), under the local metric d_{•}. Let 𝔽 be the countable set of rooted r‑ball types (all r).

Unrooted space Y and the forgetful map.
- Let Y be the set of unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with Δ≤D (or =D), endowed with the rootless local topology generated by U_Y(F):={G∈Y: ∃v B_r(G,v)≅F} for F∈𝔽. Define π:X→Y by π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is continuous, open, surjective).
- Continuity: π^{-1}(U_Y(F))=𝔾_{•}^{F} is open in X.
- Openness: π(𝔾_{•}^{F})=U_Y(F).
- Surjective: any G∈Y admits some root ρ; then (G,ρ)∈X and π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 2 (X and Y are Baire). For Δ≤D, both X and Y are compact metrizable (hence Baire). For Δ= D‑regular, they are closed subspaces of the Δ≤D spaces; thus Baire.
Sketch. For X (Δ≤D): compactness by diagonal extraction on rooted balls; limits preserve local finiteness and connectivity. Y is the continuous, open image of compact X under π and is Hausdorff (standard for this topology), hence compact. The regular subspaces are closed by local degree constraints.

Proposition 3 (Nowhere‑denseness transfers). For A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. If π^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense, some nonempty open U⊆X is contained in cl_X(π^{-1}(A)); then π(U) is nonempty open and π(U)⊆cl_Y(A), so A is not nowhere dense. Conversely, if A is not nowhere dense, pick nonempty open V⊆cl_Y(A); then π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and π^{-1}(V)⊆cl_X(π^{-1}(A)), so π^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense.

Proposition 4 (Meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. If A is meagre, pull back a countable cover by nowhere dense sets and use Proposition 3. Conversely, write A=UΔM with U open and M meagre. Then π^{-1}(A)=π^{-1}(U)Δπ^{-1}(M). If π^{-1}(A) is meagre, then π^{-1}(U) is meagre. But X is Baire, so π^{-1}(U)=∅, hence U=∅ by surjectivity of π. Thus A=M is meagre.

Corollary 5 (Conjecture 1 for natural properties). For any Borel/analytic property P of unrooted graphs, S_P:=π^{-1}(T_P) is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in X iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in Y; smallness is root‑independent.

Bounded re‑rooting invariance for section metrics.
- A section s:Y→X satisfies π∘s=Id_Y. Define d_s(G,H):=d_{•}((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).

Lemma 6 (Homeomorphism for bounded re‑rootings). If sections s,t satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤N for all G, then the identity Id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. Hence nowhere‑denseness and meagreness coincide under d_s,d_t.
Proof. If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))≅B_{r+N}(H,s(H)). Moving roots by ≤N gives B_r(G,t(G))≅B_r(H,t(H)), so d_t(G,H)≤2^{-r}. Symmetry yields the inverse continuity.

Odd‑D bridge forcing inside a cylinder (complete gadget).
- For a finite rooted subgraph H (a candidate refined ball), define the deficit S(H):=∑_{v∈V(H)}(D−deg_H(v)). In any D‑regular extension, |δ(V(H))|=S(H).
- For odd D: S(H)≡|V(H)| (mod 2).

Gadgets (degree‑safe and layer‑respecting):
- Ports: For a boundary vertex x with current deficit d_x, attach d_x disjoint 2‑edge paths x–a–b, with deg(a)=2, deg(b)=1 in the new partial graph. This moves one unit of deficit from x to b. Doing this for all boundary vertices produces S(H) ports b_i at distance +2 from the old boundary; the updated core H′ has S(H′)=S(H) and all original boundary vertices saturated (deg=D).
- Pair‑closure: For any two ports b_i,b_j, we can connect them by a bounded D‑regular filler gadget disjoint from the rest that consumes both deficits and saturates all new vertices to degree D (e.g., embed both into a copy of K_{D+1}−e, identifying b_i,b_j with the two degree‑(D−1) ends and adding the missing edge internally). Net effect: S decreases by 2; all additions are placed strictly beyond the current boundary, respecting BFS layers.
- Parity flipper (odd D): Introduce a small tree T of radius 2 attached to two distinct boundary vertices before port creation to change S by an odd amount (as in the previous round). Concretely, add a new vertex z adjacent to two boundary vertices x,y; then extend z to degree D by adding a (D−2)‑regular local gadget not touching the rest. This changes S by D−4 (odd when D is odd), enabling a transition to S odd.

Lemma 7 (Reduction to a single port). Given any rooted r‑ball F in a D‑regular graph with odd D>2, there exists a finite extension H including F (respecting layers so that H is a rooted r′‑ball) such that S(H)=1.
Proof. Start with H:=F. If S(H) is even, apply the parity flipper near the boundary to make S odd. Create ports at all boundary vertices until boundary vertices are saturated. While S>1, repeatedly apply pair‑closure to consume two ports at a time via disjoint filler gadgets; this preserves degrees ≤D and does not create shortcuts to the root because all additions are outward and glued along specified boundary vertices. Termination yields S=1 with all original boundary vertices saturated and exactly one port b* remaining at the outer boundary. The resulting H is a finite connected graph which, by our outward‑only construction and layer control, is the r′‑ball of its root for some r′.

Proposition 8 (Odd‑D bridge forcing). In 𝔾_{•,=D} with odd D>2, for any cylinder 𝔾_{•}^{F}, there is a refinement cylinder 𝔾_{•}^{F′} such that every D‑regular extension of F′ has a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense (for any cylinder‑based topology).
Proof. Take H from Lemma 7 with S(H)=1 and let F′ be its rooted r′‑ball. Any D‑regular extension G satisfies |δ(V(H))|=1; the unique edge in δ(V(H)) is a bridge of G.

Even‑D cut‑vertex forcing inside a cylinder.
- Observation: In a D‑regular graph with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges cannot occur. To force non‑2‑connectedness, centralize all external deficit through a single designated cut‑vertex c.

Lemma 9. For any rooted r‑ball F in a D‑regular graph with even D>2, there exists a finite extension H containing F (again as a rooted r′‑ball) such that in any D‑regular extension G of H, some vertex c∈V(H) is a cut vertex of G.
Proof sketch. Choose a vertex c on the boundary of F. Create ports at all other boundary vertices and pair‑close them as in Lemma 7 until all boundary vertices except possibly c are saturated. Route the remaining required deficit to c by attaching disjoint 2‑edge paths towards c and saturating intermediate vertices to degree D using local fillers, ensuring no new shorter paths to the root. Arrange that all edges leaving V(H) (there are S(H) of them, with S(H) even) are incident to c and that the removal of c disconnects H into at least two nonempty blocks (create two internally 2‑edge‑connected blobs H_1,H_2 attached to c only). In any D‑regular extension, all outside edges attach at c, hence removing c disconnects G. Degree constraints are preserved by construction. The same layer discipline shows H is a ball F′.

Consequences for Conjecture 2 (no‑go region)

- Cylinder‑based invariance: The proofs of Propositions 8 and Lemma 9 are purely by cylinder refinement. Therefore, under any metric whose open sets are unions of rooted cylinders (i.e., inducing the Benjamini–Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense in 𝔾_{•,≤D} (D>2) and in 𝔾_{•,=D} for odd D; and graphs without a cut vertex are nowhere dense for all D>2.
- Bounded re‑rootings: By Lemma 6, section metrics that change roots within uniformly bounded distance preserve typicality; thus they cannot make bridgeless graphs typical.

A genuinely non‑local alternative: occurrence topology 𝒯_occ on Y

Definition. Let 𝔽_r be the finite set of rooted r‑ball types (Δ≤D). Define the map Occ:Y→∏_{r≥0}2^{𝔽_r} by Occ(G)_r = {F∈𝔽_r : F occurs somewhere in G}. Equip ∏_{r}2^{𝔽_r} with the product topology; let 𝒯_occ be the pullback topology on Y via Occ. Equivalently, a subbasic open set is U_Y(F): “F occurs somewhere.”

Lemma 10 (Density of 1‑way infinite bridges in 𝒯_occ). For D≥3, the set B_1⊆Y of graphs having a 1‑way infinite bridge is dense in (Y,𝒯_occ).
Proof. Given finitely many required occurrences F_1,…,F_k, realize each within vertex‑disjoint finite subgraphs inside a finite connected core C while respecting Δ≤D (use fresh vertices and avoid degree overflow). Attach an infinite ray to a vertex x∈C with spare degree, and ensure all other vertices of C are saturated via local fillers; then in any completion the edge on the ray out of x is a 1‑way infinite bridge. The resulting graph contains all F_i and has Δ≤D.

Lemma 11 (Density of bridgeless graphs in 𝒯_occ). For D≥3, the set B_0⊆Y of bridgeless graphs is dense in (Y,𝒯_occ).
Proof. Given finitely many required occurrences F_1,…,F_k, realize them disjointly in a finite core C without creating bridges (add cycles/chords locally so every edge of C lies on a cycle). Extend C to an infinite bridgeless Δ≤D graph by attaching an infinite ladder‑like 2‑edge‑connected “backbone” (e.g., a 2‑edge‑connected cubic skeleton such as the 3‑regular “ladder of ladders”) and connect C to it via two edge‑disjoint paths; saturate degrees with local 2‑edge‑connected fillers. This yields a connected infinite bridgeless graph containing all F_i.

Remark. The Baire/Polish status of (Y,𝒯_occ) remains open; we have not yet proved that Occ(Y) is closed in ∏ 2^{𝔽_r}. If (Y,𝒯_occ) is Baire and both B_1 and B_0 are dense, neither is comeagre; thus “bridgeless” cannot be typical under 𝒯_occ.

Examples

- Parity sanity check (odd D): For D=3 and a tree H on m vertices, S(H)=3m−2(m−1)=m+2 is odd iff m is odd, in line with the parity flipper’s necessity.
- Section metrics: On an infinite D‑regular tree T_D, picking s(G) as any root and t(G) as a neighbor gives N=1; Lemma 6 applies.

Obstacles

- Occurrence topology: Proving that Occ(Y) is closed (hence compact) requires a projective‑limit consistency theorem for occurrence profiles; we currently only have necessary closure constraints (truncation monotonicity) and a heuristic that compactness should follow by a standard compactness/ultraproduct or Kőnig’s‑lemma argument. A full proof is pending.
- Even‑D cut‑vertex gadget: We provided a proof sketch; a fully explicit, layer‑respecting construction with precise degree bookkeeping should be written to eliminate any ambiguity.

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Propositions 3–4, and Lemma 6 to proofs.md to close Conjecture 1 and to record section‑metric invariance.
- Write a detailed, layer‑respecting proof for Lemma 7 and Proposition 8 (odd‑D bridge forcing) with explicit filler gadgets and port pairing; ensure F′ is indeed a ball.
- Provide a complete, explicit construction for Lemma 9 (even‑D cut‑vertex forcing), including routing of all deficits through c and verification that H is a ball.
- Formalize 𝒯_occ: either prove (Y,𝒯_occ) is Baire/compact by identifying Occ(Y) as a closed subshift, or provide a counterexample; then decide typicality of B_0 and B_1.

Takeaways

- Conjecture 1 is resolved for natural (Borel/analytic) properties by π‑transfer of nowhere‑denseness and meagreness.
- Conjecture 2: In all cylinder‑based topologies and bounded re‑rooting section metrics, bridgeless graphs remain non‑typical (nowhere dense or not comeagre). A non‑local occurrence topology changes density behavior (both bridgeless and 1‑way‑bridge graphs dense), but Baire status is open; settling it will decide (non‑)typicality there.


=== Prover 3 Output ===

Ideas
- Strengthen and clean up Conjecture 1: formalize transfer of nowhere‑denseness and (for Baire‑property sets) meagreness between the rooted and unrooted spaces via the forgetful map π. Add a short, self‑contained proof that the unrooted space Y (rootless local topology) is Baire using that π is continuous, open, surjective and X is Baire.
- Repair and simplify the odd‑D regular “bridge‑forcing” cylinder: construct an R‑ball F′ with L_R consisting of a single vertex z adjacent to D−1 vertices in L_{R−1}; then S(F′)=1, so every D‑regular extension has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge. This avoids parity bookkeeping gadgets and is easier to verify.
- Extend the “no‑go” region for Conjecture 2: any topology on X that refines the rooted cylinder topology inherits a nonempty interior for “has a bridge” (≤D) and for “has a 1‑way infinite bridge” (=D, odd), preventing bridgeless from being typical there.
- Coarser, root‑insensitive topology τ_any (pullback of the unrooted topology): prove Y is Baire; show in Y: “has a 1‑way infinite bridge” is dense, and (for D≥4) “bridgeless” is dense; thus neither can be typical in Y nor in (X,τ_any). For D=3, leave density of “bridgeless” open.

Formal statements and proofs
1) Forgetful map framework
Setup: X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the rooted local topology; Y the unrooted degree‑bounded space with the rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v with B_r(G,v)≅F}. Let π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is continuous, open, surjective).
Proof. For a rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=U_F^X is open in X (union over all choices of root), so π is continuous. Also π(U_F^X)=U_F^Y, hence open. Surjectivity is clear. ∎

Proposition 2 (nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly).
For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. (⇒) Let A be nowhere dense. For any nonempty open U⊆X, π(U) is nonempty open in Y; choose nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U∩π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and disjoint from π^{-1}(A). (⇐) If π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense and W⊆Y is nonempty open, then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open; pick nonempty open U′⊆π^{-1}(W) with U′∩π^{-1}(A)=∅. Then π(U′)⊆W is nonempty open disjoint from A. ∎

Corollary 3 (meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets).
If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Since A has the Baire property, some nonempty open V has A∩V comeagre. Then π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(A)∩π^{-1}(V) is comeagre in nonempty open π^{-1}(V), contradiction. ∎

2) Y is Baire
Lemma 4 (Y is a Baire space).
Proof. X is Baire (standard for the rooted local space on degree‑bounded graphs). Let U_n⊆Y be dense open. Then π^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X. Their intersection is dense in X, hence nonempty on every nonempty open O⊆X. For any nonempty open W⊆Y, π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X, so π^{-1}(W)∩⋂_n π^{-1}(U_n)≠∅, and applying π (open and surjective) yields W∩⋂_n U_n≠∅. Hence ⋂_n U_n is dense. ∎

Why useful: Typicality in τ_any (the pullback of Y) is governed by Y; in particular, if both a set and its complement are dense in Y, neither can be typical in τ_any.

3) Odd‑D regular bridge‑forcing cylinder
Proposition 5 (odd D≥3). Let F=B_r(G,ρ) occur in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r and an R‑ball F′ extending F with the following properties:
- All vertices at distance <R from the root in F′ have degree D (inside F′).
- The boundary L_R of F′ consists of a single vertex z, and deg_{F′}(z)=D−1.
Consequently, for any D‑regular extension G′ of F′, the cut δ(V(B_R(G′,ρ))) has size 1, so the unique crossing edge is a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Proof. Starting from F, extend outward layer by layer to radius R−1 so that L_{R−1} contains at least D−1 vertices (this is possible by attaching enough new vertices outward from L_r; at each step, saturate layers < current boundary to degree D by allocating their remaining degree to the newly created outer layer). At the last step, create L_R={z} and connect z to D−1 distinct vertices in L_{R−1}, adding no edges within L_R. All vertices at distance <R are saturated to degree D by construction. Then S(F′)=∑_{x∈L_R}(D−deg_{F′}x)=D−(D−1)=1. In any D‑regular supergraph, by the edge‑cut identity |δ(V(B_R))|=S(F′)=1; hence the sole edge leaving B_R is a bridge whose interior side is finite, i.e., a 1‑way infinite bridge. Nonemptiness: realize an extension by connecting z to one new vertex w outside B_R and completing outside to an infinite D‑regular graph (e.g., a D‑regular tree modified to eliminate bridges far from B_R if desired; completion is routine since only degrees outside need to be filled). ∎

Corollary 6 (no‑go for “bridgeless typical” under cylinder‑refining topologies).
- In ≤D: the 1‑ball with a leaf at the root is a cylinder contained in “has a bridge”, giving nonempty interior. Hence “bridgeless” cannot be comeagre.
- In =D, D odd: by Proposition 5, there is a cylinder contained in “has a 1‑way infinite bridge”; thus “bridgeless” cannot be comeagre.
This applies to any topology on X that contains all rooted cylinders as open sets (hence to any metric topologically finer than or equivalent to d_•).

4) Density facts in the unrooted space Y
Lemma 7 (1‑way infinite bridges are dense in Y for ≤D).
Proof. Let U_F^Y be a basic open set (F an r‑ball). Since F occurs in some graph with Δ≤D, it has a boundary vertex u∈L_r with deg_F(u)<D (Lemma 13‑type observation). Attach a pendant infinite ray to u, and complete arbitrarily elsewhere without changing the r‑ball around the occurrence of F. The first edge of the ray is a 1‑way infinite bridge. Thus U_F^Y intersects the set of graphs with a 1‑way infinite bridge. ∎

Proposition 8 (for D≥4, bridgeless graphs are dense in Y).
Proof. Fix U_F^Y. Consider the infinite grid Z^2 (degree 4), which is bridgeless. Subdivide finitely many edges of Z^2 inside a large finite box so that F embeds as a subgraph; subdivisions preserve bridgelessness and keep maximum degree ≤4. If D>4, freely append pendant 2‑paths to split degrees down to ≤D (or take Cartesian products with cycles to reach degree exactly D and then subdivide). Thus for D≥4 we obtain a bridgeless G with Δ(G)≤D that contains an occurrence of F, so G∈U_F^Y. ∎
Remark. For D=3, finding a fixed universal bridgeless host is subtler; density of bridgeless graphs in Y for D=3 is left open here.

5) Bounded re‑rooting invariance
Lemma 9. If T:X→X maps (G,ρ)↦(G,ρ′) with d_G(ρ,ρ′)≤B uniformly, then T is a homeomorphism of (X,d_•) onto its image; hence any “section metric” obtained by such re‑rootings is topologically equivalent to d_•.
Proof. For each r, U_{r+B}(x)⊆T^{-1}(U_r(Tx))⊆U_{r−B}(x), yielding continuity of T and T^{-1} on their domains. ∎

Examples
- Odd‑D gadget check for D=3: Take R so that |L_{R−1}|≥2. Set L_R={z} and connect z to two distinct vertices of L_{R−1}. Then deg_{F′}(z)=2, so S(F′)=1.
- Density of 1‑way bridges in Y for ≤D: If F’s boundary has no degree deficit (e.g., F comes from an =D occurrence), enlarge r by one and take F′ with a boundary deficit at the new layer; then apply the same ray attachment.

Obstacles
- Even D regular case: we cannot force a 1‑way infinite bridge (parity obstruction). Constructing a cylinder that forces a genuine 2‑way infinite bridge in =D, D even, remains open. The current interior “no‑go” uses cut‑vertices instead of bridges; while useful (Theorem 15), it does not by itself preclude the possibility that “bridgeless” could be comeagre under some very nonlocal topology.
- Density of bridgeless graphs in Y for D=3: a uniform bridgeless host accommodating arbitrary finite degree‑≤3 patterns as subgraphs is nontrivial. A tailored external 2‑edge‑connected completion attached by two disjoint connections should work, but a clean, degree‑bounded, fully general construction needs care.
- τ_any on X (preimage of Y’s topology): By Lemma 4, Y is Baire; π:(X,τ_any)→Y is open and continuous. Typicality of saturated properties in (X,τ_any) matches Y’s. For non‑saturated properties, category analysis requires separate work.

Next steps
- Move Lemma 1, Proposition 2, Corollary 3, and Lemma 4 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 for Borel/Baire‑property properties.
- Write a full, layer‑by‑layer construction for Proposition 5, including the degree‑saturation algorithm up to radius R−1, and the completion argument beyond B_R.
- Extend the “no‑go” corollary to any topology τ on X with the property that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is open (or more generally, that for some fixed finite pattern P witnessing a bridge, the set “contains P at bounded distance from the root” is open). Record the precise hypotheses.
- For Conjecture 2, analyze even D in =D: either build an explicit R‑ball forcing a 2‑way infinite bridge, or prove a universal obstruction. In parallel, for D=3 establish density of bridgeless graphs in Y by a degree‑bounded 2‑edge‑connected completion scheme around arbitrary F.
- If pursuing τ_any, describe an explicit complete metric inducing Y’s topology (and hence τ_any on X via pullback), to allow a black‑box Baire proof and to compare typical sets rigorously.

1) Conjecture 1 (root-invariance): formal π-transfer and section metrics

- Setup. X=𝔾_{\bullet,D} with Benjamini–Schramm topology τ_•. Y=unrooted connected countable graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) endowed with the rootless-local topology τ₀ generated by basic opens U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}.
- Lemma A (π is continuous, open, surjective). π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous and open: π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v∈V(F)} 𝔾_{\bullet}^{(F,v)} is open; images of cylinder opens are the U_F^Y.
- Proposition A1 (ND equivalence). For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,τ₀) iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,τ_•). Proof: continuity+openness give int(cl(π^{-1}(A)))⊆π^{-1}(int(cl(A))).
- Proposition A2 (Meagre equivalence for BP sets). If A has the Baire property in (Y,τ₀) (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) meagre in X. Proof via images/preimages of dense G_δ and openness of π.
- Lemma A3 (bounded re-rootings preserve topology). For section metrics d_s(G,H)=d_•((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))), if dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; inequalities d_t≤2^{K}d_s and d_s≤2^{K}d_t follow from ball containment. Consequence: typicality is root-invariant across such section metrics.

2) Conjecture 2 (no-go via finite-lens pinning): corrected odd-D regular bridge gadget

- FLP (finite-lens property). A metric/topology on X has FLP if every nonempty open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) which pins the radius-r neighborhoods of finitely many marked vertices (i.e., all incidences and non-incidences among those vertices up to radius r are specified).
- Theorem B (BrFree is nowhere dense in any FLP metric; =D odd). Fix odd D≥3. In (𝔾_{\bullet,=D}, d) with FLP, the set BrFree of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.
  Proof. Let O be nonempty open; by FLP, O⊇W(M). We refine to W′=W(M′) by grafting a finite connected seed S whose vertices are all newly added and whose radius-1 neighborhoods are fully pinned:
  Seed S (explicit). Let n=D+2 (odd). Start from K_n with distinguished vertices x,a,b and the remaining set W of size D−1 (even). Delete edges xa and xb; delete a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D−1; for v≠x, deg_S(v)=D. S is connected. Now embed S disjointly from the marks at distance ≥r+2 inside the cylinder, pinning all adjacencies among vertices of S. In any D-regular completion, vertices v≠x already have degree D entirely within the pinned region; hence no external edges can attach to them. Vertex x has degree D−1 within S, thus must have exactly one external neighbor. Therefore δ(S)=1 and the unique cross edge is incident with x, making that edge a bridge in every completion. Hence O contains an open subset disjoint from BrFree. As O was arbitrary, BrFree is nowhere dense.
  Parity note. δ(S)=∑_{v∈S}(D−deg_S(v))=1 because exactly one vertex has a unit deficit and D is odd, making |S| odd consistent with handshake parity.
- Corollary B1. In any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D}, BrFree is nowhere dense by the usual leaf-attachment in the pinned region.
- Proposition B2 (finer-topology no-go). If τ₂ refines τ₁ on X and S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₁), then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₂). Hence no metric finer than Benjamini–Schramm can make BrFree typical.

3) Even-D regular case: forcing a cut vertex under FLP

- Proposition C (NoCut is nowhere dense under FLP; =D even). For even D≥4, in any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,=D}, the set NoCut={graphs without a cut vertex} is nowhere dense.
  Proof. Let O⊇W(M). Insert a finite pinned gadget S with all vertices degree D within S except one vertex x with degree D−2. Explicit S: start from K_{D,D} with bipartition A∪B; pick x∈A, y₁,y₂∈B. Remove edges x−y₁,x−y₂; add edge y₁−y₂. Degrees: deg_S(x)=D−2; all other vertices degree D; S connected. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods of all vertices of S and place S far from existing marks. In any D-regular completion, only x can accept external edges, and exactly two are needed. Thus all cross edges are incident to x; removing x separates S\{x} from the rest, so x is a cut vertex. Therefore O contains an open subset disjoint from NoCut. Hence NoCut is nowhere dense.

4) Beyond FLP: a topological no-go scheme via finite pinning

- Definition (FPP: finite pinning property). A topology τ on X has FPP if for every nonempty open O and some x∈O, there exists an FLP-cylinder W(M) with x∈W(M)⊆O.
- Proposition D (BrFree nowhere dense under FPP; ≤D and =D odd). If τ has FPP, then the proofs of Theorem B and Corollary B1 go through verbatim, hence BrFree is nowhere dense. Similarly, for even D regular, NoCut is nowhere dense.
  Use: This extends the no-go to any “reasonable” topology with finite pinning subbasis; typicality cannot flip there.

5) Coarser, root-insensitive topology and density phenomena

- Define τ_any on Y as the quotient topology from (X,τ_•) via π, equivalently generated by U_F^Y. Then π is open and continuous; τ_any is coarser than τ_• (on X via pullback) and root-insensitive.
- Lemma E (Density of 1-way infinite bridges in τ_any; ≤D). For any nonempty U_F^Y, construct a completion containing F and attach an infinite ray R to some interior vertex u by a single edge e, respecting degree ≤D (choose u with spare capacity or pre-insert a bounded-degree buffer inside the copy of F). The resulting graph lies in U_F^Y and has a 1-way infinite bridge e. Hence {G: has a 1-way infinite bridge} is dense in (Y,τ_any).
- Heuristic (bridgeless density). In many cases, preserving F and completing the graph to be 2-edge-connected away from the pinned finite region is also possible, suggesting bridgeless graphs may be dense as well. If (Y,τ_any) were Baire, disjoint density would preclude either being comeagre, ruling out “bridgeless typical” in τ_any. However, T₁/Baire status of τ_any is subtle: π^{-1}({G}) need not be closed in X, so τ_any may fail T₁, complicating category analysis.

6) Examples/checks

- Odd D=3, seed S instance. K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w₁,w₂. Remove xa, xb, and w₁w₂. Degrees: deg(x)=2=D−1, others 3. Pinning S as above forces exactly one cross edge at x in any 3-regular completion, hence a bridge.
- Even D=4, cut gadget. K_{4,4} with parts A,B; pick x∈A,y₁,y₂∈B. Remove x−y₁, x−y₂ and add y₁−y₂. Degrees: deg(x)=2=D−2, others 4. Only x has external capacity; removing x disconnects, so x is a cut vertex in any 4-regular completion.

7) Obstacles and clarifications

- Saturation caveat. Saturating a nowhere dense set in X under re-rooting can produce a dense meagre set; thus π-based arguments (Propositions A1–A2) are essential for root-invariance.
- τ_any Baire status. Though τ_any is the quotient of compact (X,τ_•), quotient need not be Hausdorff/T₁; Baire property is unsettled here. Any claim about typicality in τ_any must await a structural analysis (T₁/T₀, Baire, possibly quasi-Polish).

8) Next steps (concrete tasks)

- Write up full proofs of Propositions A1–A2 and Lemma A3 in proofs.md (this settles Conjecture 1 for all BP properties).
- Add detailed proof of Theorem B (odd D) and Proposition C (even D) with the explicit seeds S into proofs.md, stating the pinning precisely (radius-1 neighborhoods of S vertices) and the degree-capacity argument in =D spaces.
- Formalize FPP and record Proposition D to broaden the no-go region for Conjecture 2.
- Analyze τ_any: establish separation axioms, and attempt to prove Baire or quasi-Polish. If Baire and both BrFree and “has 1-way infinite bridge” are dense, conclude neither is typical in τ_any.
- For even D-regular, mirror the FLP no-go to the “no cut vertex” property in more general topologies with FPP; document the precise gadget and argument.

Why these are useful

- The corrected odd-D gadget plugs a key gap and yields robust “no-go” for making bridgeless typical across a wide class of local metrics/topologies.
- The π-transfer resolves Conjecture 1 for all natural (BP) properties cleanly and generally.
- The even-D cut-vertex gadget extends typicality obstruction to the regular even case, aligning with Theorem 15 and transferring to FLP/FPP settings.
- The τ_any density result identifies a promising coarser regime where behavior changes, focusing future work on its Baire status to settle Conjecture 2 in either direction.

Ideas

- Strengthen Conjecture 1: prove meagreness is root‑invariant without any definability/Baire‑property hypotheses on P, using the forgetful map π from rooted to unrooted spaces and the fact that π is an open, continuous surjection (quotient map). This upgrades the prior “Baire‑property” assumption to a full equivalence for all A⊆Y.
- Fix the even‑D D‑regular gadget. Give an explicit finite extension forcing δ=2 with both units of deficit concentrated at the root; in any D‑regular completion this makes the root a cut vertex. This repairs the gap flagged in the feedback.
- For Conjecture 2, formalize a coarser “tail” topology and show that both “has a bridge” and “is bridgeless” have nonempty interior there. If the tail space is Baire, neither set is comeagre, hence bridgeless cannot be typical in that topology.

Root→unroot quotient and full root‑invariance (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the BS topology and Y the space of unrooted, connected, countable graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) endowed with the rootless‑local topology generated by sets U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v B_r(G,v)≅F}. Let π:X→Y be π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma A (π is open quotient). π is continuous, open, surjective and Y carries the quotient topology: U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open in X.
Proof. For any rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v} \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{(F,v)} is open; openness of π follows since every open in X is a union of cylinders whose images are rootless cylinders; surjectivity is clear.

Lemma B (closure transport). For all A⊆Y, π^{-1}(\overline{A}^Y)=\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X.
Proof. Standard for quotient maps: C⊆Y is closed iff π^{-1}(C) is closed; intersect over closed C⊇A.

Theorem C (nowhere‑dense equivalence). For all A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. If A is nowhere dense, then int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)=∅; if U⊆X is nonempty open contained in \overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X, then π(U) is nonempty open (Lemma A) and by Lemma B π(U)⊆\overline{A}^Y, contradiction. The converse is symmetric.

Theorem D (meagreness equivalence for all A). For all A⊆Y, A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages preserve meagreness since they preserve nowhere denseness (Theorem C). (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y such that A∩V is comeagre in V. Since V\(A∩V) is meagre in V, we can write V\(A∩V)⊆⋃ (N_n∩V) with N_n nowhere dense in Y. Then in the subspace π^{-1}(V), π^{-1}(N_n) are nowhere dense: indeed cl_{π^{-1}(V)}(π^{-1}(N_n)) = cl_X(π^{-1}(N_n))∩π^{-1}(V) = π^{-1}(cl_Y(N_n))∩π^{-1}(V), whose interior in π^{-1}(V) is empty because int_Y(cl_Y(N_n))=∅ by nowhere denseness and π is open/quotient as in Theorem C. Hence π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(V)\⋃ π^{-1}(N_n) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), contradicting that π^{-1}(A) is meagre.

Consequences. Conjecture 1 holds in full generality: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense/meagre in X iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense/meagre in Y. This covers all properties in Theorems 14–17 and beyond.

A corrected even‑D D‑regular cut‑vertex forcing gadget

We work in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4.

Notation. For a finite rooted ball F with boundary L, let f_F(v)=D−deg_F(v) for v∈L and δ(F)=Σ_{v∈L} f_F(v).

Lemma E (finite degree‑completion preserving a core). Let D≥2 and H be a finite simple graph with max degree ≤D. Let t:V(H)→{0,1,…,D} satisfy deg_H(v)≤t(v)≤D. Then there exists a finite simple graph J⊇H (H induced in J) with deg_J(v)=t(v) for v∈V(H) and deg_J(u)≤D for u∈V(J)\V(H).
Sketch. Let s(v)=t(v)−deg_H(v) be the required increments on old vertices and S=Σ_v s(v). Choose T≫S,D with T even. Add T new vertices W. Injectively assign to each old vertex v a set A_v⊆W of size s(v) so that no new vertex is assigned by more than one old vertex (possible since T≫S). Put edges between v and all w∈A_v. Each new vertex w now has preliminary degree 0 or 1 to old vertices; choose a D′∈{D,D−1} with Σ_w D′−deg(w) even, and fill the remaining degrees on W by adding a simple graph on W of degree sequence d_w∈[0,D] so that each w achieves total degree exactly D (Erdős–Gallai criterion can be met for large T). Then H is induced; old vertices hit target degrees t(v); new vertices have degree ≤D.

Proposition F (forcing a cut vertex at the root in even D). Fix even D≥4. Given any rooted r‑ball F in a D‑regular graph, there exists r′ and an extension F* with the following properties:
- All vertices in F* other than the root ρ have degree D within F* (hence f_{F*}(v)=0 for all boundary vertices v≠ρ).
- The root ρ has degree D−2 within F* (hence f_{F*}(ρ)=2), so δ(F*)=2 and all deficit is concentrated at ρ.
Consequently, in any D‑regular (infinite) extension G of F*, both cross edges leaving F* are incident to ρ, and ρ is a cut vertex of G.
Proof. Starting from F, enlarge within finitely many steps to a finite subgraph H containing the r‑ball such that deg_H(ρ)=D−2 and deg_H(u)≤D for all u≠ρ, while keeping H induced on its vertex set (achieved by adding new vertices and edges only incident to boundary vertices other than ρ). Now apply Lemma E with target degrees t(ρ)=D−2 and t(u)=D for u≠ρ to obtain J with H induced and all non‑root vertices saturated to degree D within J. Let F* be the rooted ball of J of sufficiently large radius to encompass H (no harm if some vertices of J lie exactly on the boundary). Then f_{F*}(ρ)=2 and all other boundary deficits vanish. In any D‑regular extension G of F*, the number of cross edges equals δ(F*)=2, and since all other boundary vertices have no deficit, both cross edges must be incident to ρ. Removing ρ disconnects the finite set V(F*)\{ρ} from the rest of G, so ρ is a cut vertex.

This yields an explicit finite refinement forcing a cut vertex, closing the even‑D case robustly (and aligning with Theorem 15).

Odd‑D parity gadget (recap, with a compact proof)

For odd D, let Q_D be K_{D+1}−e with deficit vertices a,b. Pairwise deficit reduction via identifying a,b with two boundary vertices decreases δ by 2 without creating new deficits (all new vertices are D‑regular). Iterating yields δ=1 (odd parity forces a minimum of 1), and then the unique cross edge exists in every D‑regular extension, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge is forced. This justifies the odd‑D case used in Theorem 14(ii).

Conjecture 2: a coarser tail topology and a non‑typicality obstruction

Define the tail topology τ_tail on X by the base
U_R(G,ρ) = { (H,σ): ∃ root‑preserving isomorphism φ: G\B_R(G,ρ) → H\B_R(H,σ) mapping ∂B_R(G,ρ) to ∂B_R(H,σ) }.
Intuitively, U_R(G,ρ) fixes the “outside” beyond radius R up to a boundary identification, while allowing arbitrary changes inside the ball.

Observation G (both bridgeful and bridgeless have nonempty interior in τ_tail). If G has a bridge e outside B_R(G,ρ), then U_R(G,ρ)⊆{bridgeful}. Conversely, there exist graphs G with no bridge outside B_R(G,ρ) (e.g., any 2‑edge‑connected graph with large girth seen from ρ), yielding U_R(G,ρ)⊆{bridgeless}. Hence both sets have nonempty interior in τ_tail.
Proof. Immediate from the definition: the outside structure (where the certificate edge lies, or the 2‑edge‑connectivity holds) is fixed throughout U_R(G,ρ).

Corollary H (conditional non‑typicality under τ_tail). If (X,τ_tail) is a Baire space, then neither the bridgeful set nor the bridgeless set is comeagre. In particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical in τ_tail.
Proof. In a Baire space, a comeagre set must be dense; but both sets have disjoint nonempty open subsets by Observation G, so neither is dense.

Examples

- Odd D=3 gadget: Starting with any rooted cylinder F in 3‑regular graphs, iterative Q_3=K_4−e attachments reduce δ to 1; any extension has exactly one cross edge, which is a 1‑way infinite bridge.
- Even D=4 cut‑vertex: From any F, enlarge to F* with deg_{F*}(ρ)=2 and all other boundary vertices saturated to degree 4. In any 4‑regular extension, the only cross edges are two edges at ρ, so ρ is a cut vertex.

Obstacles

- Tail topology τ_tail: establishing its Baire (or Polish) status remains open; without this, Corollary H is conditional. Identifying τ_tail as an inverse limit of compact spaces (or a continuous open image of a compact) would settle Baire‑ness.
- Alternative topologies: Designing a Baire, non‑cylinder‑based metric where bridgeless becomes comeagre seems unlikely in light of Observation G‑style obstructions; formalizing a broad no‑go theorem requires a general criterion on topologies where “outside fixing” creates clopen obstructions.

Next steps

- Add Lemmas A–B, Theorems C–D to proofs.md, fully settling Conjecture 1 (meagreness and nowhere‑denseness root‑invariant for all P).
- Insert Proposition F (even‑D cut‑vertex forcing) with Lemma E into proofs.md; this also strengthens the no‑go zone for Conjecture 2 across any topology admitting rooted cylinders as neighborhoods.
- Analyze τ_tail rigorously: characterize basic compact quotients by “outside beyond R,” prove Baire property (or find a counterexample). If Baire, Corollary H rules out bridgeless typicality there.
- Explore an “occurrence‑from‑root” coarser pseudometric d_occ by comparing the sets {B_r(G,v): dist(ρ,v)≤r}; determine whether its Kolmogorov quotient is Baire and whether bridgeful/bridgeless both have nonempty interior, yielding another negative instance for Conjecture 2.
