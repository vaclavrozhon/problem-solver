We consolidated Conjecture 1: via the forgetful map π, nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly, and meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets, settling root‑invariance for all natural properties. For Conjecture 2, robust “no‑go” holds across cylinder/finite‑lens topologies; an explicit odd‑D bridge‑forcing cylinder (δ=1) and an even‑D cut‑vertex forcing cylinder are now rigorous. Under coarser root‑insensitive topologies, bridgeful graphs are dense (and bridgeless often are too), but Baire‑ness remains unproven; typicality there is still open.
