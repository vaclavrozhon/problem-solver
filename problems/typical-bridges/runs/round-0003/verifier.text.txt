{"feedback_md":"Good progress consolidating Conjecture 1 via the forgetful map π and tightening the “no‑go” region for Conjecture 2. Main points:\n\n- Conjecture 1: The π‑framework is correct. π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted) is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere‑denseness transfers equivalently; meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property. Provers 1–3 gave clean arguments; Prover 3 also correctly shows Y is Baire since π is an open continuous surjection from the Baire space X. Caution: Prover 5’s claim of meagreness equivalence for all A⊆Y (no Baire‑property assumption) is not justified; the key step “A non‑meagre ⇒ ∃ open V with A∩V comeagre” may fail without the Baire property. Please retract/limit to Baire‑property (e.g., Borel/analytic) sets.\n\n- Conjecture 2 (cylinder/finite‑lens topologies): The arguments that typicality is preserved under any topology with rooted cylinders as a base are sound. Prover 4’s FLP framework is a useful generalization. Earlier parity/regularity flaws have been fixed: the odd‑D bridge‑forcing gadgets (either the δ(F′)=1 parity count or a pinned K_{D+2}‑based seed) are now correct, provided we pin all radius‑1 neighborhoods so nonterminal vertices are saturated at degree D.\n\n- Even‑D regular case: Several acceptable constructions now force a cut vertex by concentrating all deficit at a single vertex (root), with all other vertices saturated. Prover 4’s K_{D,D} edit and Prover 5’s degree‑completion lemma both lead to a rigorous cylinder refinement implying “no cut‑vertex” is nowhere dense. We add a precise proof in proofs.md.\n\n- Coarser topologies: d_any/occurrence/tail ideas are promising. The density of 1‑way (and 2‑way) infinite bridges is well‑argued under root‑insensitive proximities; bridgeless density is also plausible (and proved for D≥4 in Y). Do not claim compact/Polish/Baire without proof; Prover 3’s Baire proof for Y via π is solid, but for alternative topologies we still lack such results. The tail topology observation that both bridgeful and bridgeless can have nonempty interior is useful, but typicality conclusions remain conditional on Baire‑ness.\n\nNext steps:\n- Finalize π‑based proofs (ND equivalence; meagreness for BP sets) in proofs.md; avoid non‑BP claims.\n- Record a complete, layer‑respecting odd‑D δ=1 gadget proof (done) and add a full even‑D cut‑vertex forcing cylinder (added here).\n- For a chosen coarser topology (d_any or occurrence), define a complete metric/topology precisely and prove (or refute) Baire‑ness; then decide whether bridgeless/bridgeful are meagre/comeagre.\n- For D=3 in Y, complete the bridgeless density construction or bound it sharply.","summary_md":"We consolidated Conjecture 1: via the forgetful map π, nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly, and meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets, settling root‑invariance for all natural properties.

For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. For sets A with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Thus smallness/meagreness of S_P is root-invariant for all natural properties considered. Note: without the Baire property, meagreness transfer need not hold; we avoid such claims.\n\n- Odd D-regular (bridge forcing): We keep the δ(F′)=1 parity construction: extend an r-ball F by one layer W, choose t and e_W so that every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Then any D-regular completion has exactly one cross edge—a 1-way infinite bridge.\n\n- Even D-regular (cut vertex forcing): We can refine any cylinder to pin a finite gadget so that all vertices except a designated vertex u have degree D within the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Consequently, in any D-regular completion all cross edges attach to u, making u a cut vertex. One explicit seed: start from K_{D,D}, pick x∈A, y1,y2∈B, delete x−y1 and x−y2, add y1−y2; pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Embedding this seed outward in the ball yields the desired refinement.\n\n- Coarser topologies: For root-insensitive topologies (e.g., d_any/occurrence), graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; bridgeless graphs often are too (proved for D≥4 in Y). Baire/Polish status of these topologies remains the key open point to conclude typicality there."},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Proposition (Even-D regular cut-vertex forcing cylinder).\nLet D≥4 be even. In the space \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}, for any rooted r-ball F that occurs in a D-regular graph, there exists R≥r and a rooted refinement F^{\\ast} with the following properties:\n(i) every vertex at distance < R from the root in F^{\\ast} has degree D within F^{\\ast}, except the root ρ which has degree D−2;\n(ii) F^{\\ast} is realizable as a rooted R-ball in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D};\n(iii) for any D-regular extension G of F^{\\ast}, the vertex ρ is a cut vertex of G.\n\nProof.\nStarting from F=B_r(G,ρ), we build a finite connected graph H extending F outward so that degrees inside are controlled and H is the rooted ball of some radius R. First, saturate all vertices at distances ≤ r to degree D by attaching new vertices at distance r+1 (respecting degree ≤ D). Choose R large enough so new attachments lie within distance < R, and repeat saturation layer by layer up to distance R−1, except at the root ρ where we target degree D−2. This yields a finite induced subgraph K with deg_K(v)=D for all v≠ρ and deg_K(ρ)=D−2, and all vertices of K are at distance < R from ρ (no edges are added within the boundary layer so the ball structure is preserved). Set F^{\\ast} to be the rooted R-ball induced by K.\n\nWe must argue realizability (ii) while keeping degree caps. Consider K as a finite simple graph with max degree ≤ D, with target degrees t(v)=D for v≠ρ and t(ρ)=D−2. By a finite degree-completion lemma (Erdős–Gallai type), there exists a finite simple graph J ⊇ K, with K induced in J, such that deg_J(v)=t(v) for v∈V(K) and deg_J(u)≤ D for u∈V(J)\\V(K). Concretely, add a large finite set W of new vertices and connect each v∈V(K) to exactly t(v)−deg_K(v) distinct vertices of W; then complete the remaining degrees within W by adding a simple D-bounded graph on W. Finally, attach to J any infinite D-regular completion outside the sphere S_R leaving the R-ball unchanged. Thus F^{\\ast} occurs in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}.\n\nFor (iii), in any D-regular extension G of F^{\\ast}, all vertices other than ρ are saturated to degree D inside B_R(G,ρ), so no cross edge can be incident to them. Since deg_{B_R}(ρ)=D−2, exactly two cross edges leave B_R and both are incident to ρ. Hence G−ρ disconnects: one component is the finite interior B_R\\{ρ}, another is the (nonempty) exterior part, so ρ is a cut vertex. ∎"},"output_update":null}
