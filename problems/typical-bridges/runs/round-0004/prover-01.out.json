Forgetful map, Baire property, and meagre/nowhere\u2011dense transfer (Conjecture 1)\n\nSpaces and map.\n- X=G_{\\bullet,D}: rooted, countably infinite, connected graphs with maximum degree \u2264D or =D, under the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology generated by cylinders G_\\bullet^F.\n- Y=G_{\\varnothing,D}: unrooted counterpart with rootless\u2011local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: \u2203v B_r(G,v)\u2245F}.\n- \u03c0:X\u2192Y given by \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma A1. \u03c0 is continuous, open, and surjective, with \u03c0(G_\\bullet^F)=U_F^Y and \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=G_\\bullet^F.\n\nLemma A2 (closure/interior commute with \u03c0^{-1}). For all A\u2286Y: cl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y A) and int_X \u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u03c0^{-1}(int_Y A).\nProof. As in prior rounds; openness of \u03c0 gives the reverse inclusion in closures by a standard neighborhood\u2011lifting argument; interiors follow by complementing.\n\nProposition A3 (nowhere denseness equivalence). For any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. Use int cl identities and surjectivity.\n\nProposition A4 (meagre equivalence for Baire\u2011property sets). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. \u201c\u21d2\u201d by A3 and countable unions. For \u201c\u21d0\u201d, if \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not, there exists nonempty open V\u2282Y with A comeagre in V; then \u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and \u03c0^{-1}(A) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradiction in Baire X.\n\nLemma A5 (Y is Baire). X is compact (hence Baire) for bounded degree (standard in local convergence theory). Since \u03c0 is open, continuous, onto, Y is Baire: if Y=\u22c3_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense, then X=\u22c3_n \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is meagre, impossible.\n\nCorollary A6 (Conjecture 1). For any unrooted property P and S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P), smallness is root\u2011invariant: S_P nowhere dense in X iff T_P nowhere dense in Y; and if T_P has the Baire property (in particular Borel/analytic), S_P meagre in X iff T_P meagre in Y.\n\nRemark. Natural properties (bridges, cut vertices, chromatic constraints) are analytic/Borel as they are definable by countable Boolean combinations of cylinder conditions and thus have the Baire property.\n\nB. No\u2011go for ball\u2011local topologies (Conjecture 2)\n\nDefinition B1. A topology \u03c4 on X is ball\u2011local if {G_\\bullet^F} is a base for \u03c4.\n\nTheorem B2. In any ball\u2011local topology on X, the conclusions of Theorems 14\u201317 persist. In particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense and cannot be typical in any ball\u2011local metric.\nProof. All proofs proceed by cylinder refinement F\u21a6F\u2032 that forces a local obstruction in every extension. Such refinements depend only on the extension poset of rooted finite balls and therefore work verbatim for any \u03c4 with the same base.\n\nC. Odd\u2011D regular: a compact parity gadget forcing a unique external edge\n\nFor a finite connected F, write S(F)=\u2211_{v\u2208V(F)}(D\u2212deg_F(v))=D|V(F)|\u22122|E(F)|; in any D\u2011regular completion H\u2287F, |\u03b4_H(V(F))|=S(F). For odd D, S(F)\u2261|V(F)| mod 2.\n\nProposition C1. Let D odd \u22653 and let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) be any rooted r\u2011ball occurring in a D\u2011regular graph (as in G_{\\bullet,=D}). There exists r\u2032>r and F\u2032 (an r\u2032\u2011ball), with max degree \u2264D, such that S(F\u2032)=1. Consequently, any D\u2011regular extension of F\u2032 has exactly one edge leaving V(F\u2032), which is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof. Let L be the boundary of F, c=\u2211_{v\u2208L}(D\u2212deg_F(v))\u2265|L|. Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1; connect each v\u2208L to D\u2212deg_F(v) distinct vertices in W (total c edges). Add e_W internal edges on W so that e_W=(Dt\u2212c\u22121)/2; choose t\u2265c with t\u2261c+1 (mod 2) to make e_W integer and feasible within degree bounds (greedy construction yields simple graphs with prescribed e_W and degrees \u2264D). Then S(F\u2032)=Dt\u2212(c+2e_W)=1; all vertices at distance \u2264 r have degree D in F\u2032, so F\u2032 is an (r+1)\u2011ball. In any D\u2011regular completion H, exactly one edge leaves V(F\u2032), a bridge with finite side V(F\u2032). \u220e\n\nD. Even\u2011D regular: an explicit cut\u2011vertex forcing gadget\n\nProposition D1. Let D even \u22654 and F=B_r(G,\u03c1) occur in some D\u2011regular graph. There exists a refinement F\u2032 (an r\u2032\u2011ball) with max degree \u2264D and a vertex u\u2208V(F\u2032) such that: (i) deg_{F\u2032}(u)=D\u22122 and all other vertices in F\u2032 have degree D; (ii) F\u2032\u2212u is connected. Consequently, in any D\u2011regular extension H\u2287F\u2032, both external edges of F\u2032 attach to u, and u is a cut vertex of H.\n\nProof. Start with K_{D+2} and delete a fixed perfect matching M_1, obtaining a D\u2011regular connected graph R. Pick a vertex x; choose y,z so that yz\u2208M_1 (hence yz\u2209E(R)). Remove the edges xy,xz from R to obtain degrees deg(x)=D\u22122, deg(y)=deg(z)=D\u22121. Add the edge yz (previously absent in R) to restore deg(y)=deg(z)=D. All other vertices remain at degree D. Denote the resulting graph by R*. It is connected, and R*\u2212x is connected. Now graft R* disjointly onto F at distance \u2265r+1, and saturate all vertices within distance \u2264r\u2032 to preserve that all vertices in F\u2032 except u:=x have degree D (routine: keep attachments strictly outside the chosen ball). Then S(F\u2032)=2, so every D\u2011regular completion H adds exactly two external edges and they both must hit u. Removing u then disconnects H into (F\u2032\u2212u) and the outside, so u is a cut vertex. \u220e\n\nE. Theorem 16: \u201c2\u2011way infinite bridge within distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense via edge\u2011replacement gadgets\n\nFor k\u2208\\mathbb{N}, let A_k be the set of rooted graphs (G,\u03c1) in X such that there exists a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at graph distance \u2264k from \u03c1.\n\nProposition E1. Each A_k is nowhere dense in any ball\u2011local topology on X; consequently T_{2wb}=\u22c3_k A_k is meagre.\n\nProof. Fix a cylinder C=G_\\bullet^F and k. Let E_k be the set of edges of F with both endpoints at distance \u2264k from the root. For each e=uv\u2208E_k, replace e inside F by a fixed 2\u2011terminal, 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadget \u0398 as follows: delete uv; introduce a small gadget with two designated terminals s,t, and connect u to s and v to t (one edge each). Choose \u0398 so that (a) every edge of \u0398 lies on a cycle (e.g., two internally disjoint s\u2013t paths), (b) internal degrees \u22643\u2264D (since D>2), and (c) the connections u\u2013s and v\u2013t are the only incidences with original vertices, preserving deg(u),deg(v). Do this simultaneously for all e\u2208E_k using pairwise disjoint gadgets placed beyond distance \u2264k but within radius r\u2032. The resulting refined r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 defines a cylinder C\u2032\u2282C. In any extension of F\u2032, every edge originally at distance \u2264k from the root has been replaced by edges of \u0398 that lie on cycles within \u0398, hence cannot be bridges. Thus no 2\u2011way infinite bridge exists at distance \u2264k. Therefore C\u2032\u2229A_k=\u2205, proving A_k is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nRemark. The key correction is to replace edges by 2\u2011terminal gadgets rather than attach additional edges to saturated vertices; this preserves degrees of interior vertices while ensuring non\u2011bridgeness of all edges within distance \u2264k in any extension.\n\nF. Bounded re\u2011rooting equivalence for section metrics\n\nLemma F1. If s,t:Y\u2192X are sections with sup_G dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264R, then the identity (Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, typicality is invariant across such section metrics.\n\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G))\u2245B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r\u2212R}(G,t(G))\u2245B_{r\u2212R}(H,t(H)) by moving roots at most R; this gives mutual continuity and inverse continuity.\n\nG. Notes toward Conjecture 2 under root\u2011insensitive topologies\n\n- The previously proposed re\u2011rooting pseudometric d_any does capture density phenomena (both bridgeful and bridgeless sets dense), but we have not yet established the triangle inequality nor Baire\u2011ness of the induced quotient. We therefore refrain from asserting metric properties here.\n- A promising alternative is the \u201coccurrence pattern\u201d topology on Y obtained by embedding G\u21a6(1_{F occurs in G})_{F\u2208\u222a_r T_r}\u2208{0,1}^{\u222a_r T_r}, where T_r is the finite set of rooted r\u2011balls (degree\u2011bounded). This yields a compact, zero\u2011dimensional space; understanding the image subspace (closedness; Baire) and typicality of bridges there is a concrete next step. Caution: density results may fail for highly homogeneous graphs (e.g., D\u2011regular tree), since adding a 1\u2011way bridge may introduce new small ball types.\n\nExamples and checks\n\n- Odd D parity gadget C1 instantiated: D=3, take F any 3\u2011regular cylinder; choose t=c+1 (c=S(F)), then e_W=(3(c+1)\u2212c\u22121)/2=c. Build W with t vertices and e_W=c edges so that degrees \u22643; possible for t large enough by a standard pairing argument.\n- Even D cut\u2011vertex gadget D1 instantiated: D=4, work inside K_6 minus one perfect matching to obtain a 4\u2011regular R. Choose x and y,z matched in the deleted matching; remove xy,xz and add yz to get deg(x)=2, others 4. Grafting yields a cylinder F\u2032 whose every 4\u2011regular extension has a cut vertex u=x.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move A3\u2013A5 proofs to proofs.md to seal Conjecture 1 for all natural (Borel/analytic) properties.\n- Write the gadget\u2011based proofs C1, D1, and E1 formally with explicit \u0398 gadgets (e.g., two disjoint s\u2013t paths of lengths 2 and 3), and degree checks for both \u2264D and =D cases.\n- Choose an explicit root\u2011insensitive topology (occurrence pattern or a refined variant) and decide its Baire status. If Baire and both bridgeful and bridgeless sets are dense, neither can be comeagre, yielding a negative instance for \u201cbridgeless typicality\u201d under that topology. If non\u2011Baire, adjust to a complete metric variant.\n- For Conjecture 2 positive direction: seek a topology where bridgeless is comeagre by enforcing 2\u2011edge\u2011connectivity at all scales via basic opens; argue whether such a topology is too coarse (i.e., not Hausdorff) or fails to be natural.\n"
