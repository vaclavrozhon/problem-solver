  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Conjecture 1: Close the loop with \u03c0:X\u2192Y (forgetting the root). Prove Y is Baire via \u03c0 being continuous and open and apply a direct category argument. This gives root\u2011invariance for nowhere denseness and, for Baire\u2011property sets, for meagreness.\n- Odd\u2011D gadget: Provide a fully layer\u2011respecting construction that forces a unique cross edge S(H)=1 and certify H is actually a rooted ball. This removes the remaining parity/regularity gaps.\n- Conjecture 2: Build a concrete, compact metric d_new on X that mixes the rooted local metric with a global \u201coccurrence\u201d component. Show that under d_new, bridgeless graphs are dense (hence not nowhere dense), while they are nowhere dense under d_\u2022. This already exhibits a change in the nowhere\u2011dense collection; typicality (comeagre vs not) under d_new remains open. On the unrooted side, in the occurrence topology both \u201chas a 1\u2011way bridge\u201d and \u201cbridgeless\u201d are dense; since the space is Baire (by \u03c0), neither is typical there.\n\nUnrooted space, forgetful map, and Baire property\n\nLet X:=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,D} with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) under d_\u2022. Let Y be the unrooted space with the rootless local topology generated by U_Y(F):={G: \u2203v B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. Define \u03c0:X\u2192Y by \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma A (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective). For any rooted ball F, \u03c0(\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F)=U_Y(F) and \u03c0^{-1}(U_Y(F))=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F.\n\nLemma B (X is compact metric; Y is Baire). X is compact (standard diagonal argument on rooted balls). \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective. If Y=\u22c3_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense, then X=\u22c3_n \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is a countable union of nowhere dense sets in X (by the same equivalence used below), contradicting that X is Baire. Hence Y is Baire. (This uses that open continuous surjective images of Baire spaces are Baire.)\n\nProposition C (Transfer of nowhere denseness). For A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. Proof: As in earlier rounds\u2014openness of \u03c0 gives one direction; continuity and surjectivity give the other.\n\nProposition D (Meagreness for Baire\u2011property sets). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Proof: Pull back a nowhere\u2011dense cover; conversely, write A=U\u0394M with U open and M meagre; if \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre then \u03c0^{-1}(U) is meagre; X Baire \u21d2 \u03c0^{-1}(U)=\u2205 \u21d2 U=\u2205.\n\nCorollary E (Conjecture 1). For any Borel/analytic unrooted property P, the smallness (nowhere dense, meagre) of S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) is root\u2011independent.\n\nOdd\u2011D bridge forcing: fully pinned cylinder refinement\n\nNotation. For a finite connected rooted subgraph H (intended as a refined ball around the given root), define S(H):=\u2211_{v\u2208V(H)}(D\u2212deg_H(v)). In any D\u2011regular extension, |\u03b4(V(H))|=S(H). For odd D, S(H)\u2261|V(H)| (mod 2).\n\nGadgets.\n- Port creation: For a boundary vertex x (one with some neighbor outside H), attach d_x:=D\u2212deg_H(x) disjoint 2\u2011edge paths x\u2013a\u2013b (new vertices), and then saturate a and b to degree D using only new edges within the layer outside H. This moves one unit of deficit from x to a new port b at distance +2, without changing S(H).\n- Pair closure: Given two ports b_i,b_j, embed them as the two degree\u2011(D\u22121) vertices of a copy of K_{D+1}\u2212e placed entirely outside the current layer and add the missing edge inside the gadget. This consumes two units of deficit and saturates all new vertices to degree D; net effect S decreases by 2.\n- Parity flipper (odd D): Attach a new vertex z adjacent to two boundary vertices x,y; then saturate z to degree D with new edges placed outward. Net effect \u0394S=D\u22124 is odd when D is odd.\n\nLemma F (Reduction to S=1 while preserving the ball structure). Let F be any rooted r\u2011ball occurring in a D\u2011regular graph with odd D>2. There exists a finite connected extension H\u2287F built by outward gadgets such that S(H)=1 and H is itself a rooted r\u2032\u2011ball (for some r\u2032>r) of any D\u2011regular extension.\nProof. Start with H_0:=F. If S(H_0) is even, apply the parity flipper once. Repeatedly: port\u2011create at each boundary vertex until all original boundary vertices are saturated; while S>1, pair\u2011close two ports via disjoint copies of K_{D+1}\u2212e placed in the next layer. All insertions attach only to the current boundary, hence no shortcuts to the root are created; distances of new vertices are strictly larger than the current boundary radius, so the outward boundary advances by a bounded amount each step. The process terminates with S=1 and all interior vertices saturated. The outward\u2011only wiring guarantees that H is a ball of some radius r\u2032.\n\nProposition G (Odd\u2011D bridge forcing). In \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,=D} with odd D>2, given any cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F there is a refinement cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} such that every D\u2011regular extension of F\u2032 contains a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge. Proof. Take H from Lemma F, let F\u2032 be its rooted ball. Any extension has |\u03b4(V(H))|=1, so the unique cross edge is a bridge.\n\nEven\u2011D regular: cut vertex forcing\n\nLemma H (Even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing). In \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,=D} with even D>2, given any cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F there is a refinement \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} such that every D\u2011regular extension of F\u2032 has a cut vertex. Proof sketch. As in the odd case, outwardly port\u2011create and pair\u2011close to saturate all boundary vertices except a designated c on the boundary. Route all remaining deficit to c by creating outward trees and saturating intermediate vertices so that all cross edges must be incident to c. Inside H, ensure removing c disconnects H into at least two nonempty blocks (prepare two 2\u2011edge\u2011connected blobs attached only to c). Then in any extension, removing c disconnects G. Layer\u2011respecting insertion guarantees F\u2032 is a rooted ball.\n\nOccurrence topology on Y and density of bridges/bridgeless\n\nDefine Occ:Y\u21922^{\ud835\udd3d} by Occ(G):={F\u2208\ud835\udd3d: F occurs somewhere in G}. Equip 2^{\ud835\udd3d} with the product discrete topology (Cantor space). Let \ud835\udcaf_occ be the pullback topology on Y via Occ, i.e., subbasic opens are \u201cF occurs somewhere\u201d. This is exactly the quotient topology from \u03c0 (since \u03c0(\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F)=U_Y(F)), hence \ud835\udcaf_occ is the rootless local topology. By Lemma B, (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) is Baire.\n\nLemma I (Density of 1\u2011way bridges in (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) for \u0394\u2264D). Fix a nonempty basic open W=\u22c2_{i\u2208I}U_Y(F_i)\u22c2\u22c2_{j\u2208J}(Y\\U_Y(F\u2032_j)). Let R be the maximum radius among F_i,F\u2032_j. There exists G\u2208W with \u0394\u2264D that has a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof (construction). Build a finite connected core C that realizes all F_i disjointly and avoids all F\u2032_j within radius R around every vertex: choose C with girth >2R and design degrees \u2264D, then embed the rooted patterns F_i into C far apart (this is possible since patterns and R are finite; use fresh vertices and local fillers to keep degrees \u2264D; large girth ensures no F\u2032_j appears). Choose a vertex y\u2208C with deg(y)<D (always possible since we control C). Construct a finite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected block S with girth >2R and degrees \u2264D that also avoids all F\u2032_j within radius R. Join S to C by a single new edge e=ys. Let K be any infinite \u0394\u2264D extension glued to the rest of C (disjoint from S) that preserves avoidance of F\u2032_j up to radius R (e.g., a large\u2011girth 2\u2011edge\u2011connected infinite backbone), and connect C to K far from y by one edge to ensure overall connectivity. The edge e is a bridge; one component (S and its interior) is finite, so e is 1\u2011way infinite. Occurrences of F_i persist, and by girth >2R no F\u2032_j is created anywhere. Thus G\u2208W and has a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\n\nLemma J (Density of bridgeless graphs in (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) for \u0394\u2264D). With W and R as above, there exists G\u2208W that is infinite, connected, bridgeless, with \u0394\u2264D.\nProof (construction). Build C as in Lemma I to realize F_i and avoid F\u2032_j up to radius R. Attach an infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected backbone B of girth >2R and degrees \u2264D (e.g., an infinite ladder\u2011of\u2011ladders of maximum degree 3, then augment degrees by bounded local 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadgets to meet any target \u2264D), and connect C to B by two edge\u2011disjoint paths from distinct vertices of C with spare degree. The result is connected and bridgeless. Large girth ensures no F\u2032_j appears; F_i persist by design.\n\nCorollary K. In (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ) both the sets B_1 (has a 1\u2011way infinite bridge) and B_0 (bridgeless) are dense. Since Y is Baire, neither is comeagre; thus bridgeless is not typical in \ud835\udcaf_occ.\n\nA compact alternative metric on X mixing local and occurrence information\n\nLet Z:=Occ(Y)\u22862^{\ud835\udd3d} with the Cantor metric d_C (Z is compact metric). Define \u03a6:=Occ\u2218\u03c0:X\u2192Z. Fix \u03b5\u2208(0,1). Define a metric on X by\nd_new(x,y):= d_C(\u03a6(x),\u03a6(y)) + \u03b5\u00b7d_\u2022(x,y).\nThen (X,d_new) is compact (x\u21a6(\u03a6(x),x) embeds X into Z\u00d7X; product is compact, sum metric induces subspace topology). In d_new, a neighborhood base at x is given by sets of the form V = \u03c0^{-1}(O_Z) \u2229 U_{\u2022}, where O_Z is a Cantor cylinder (finitely many occurrence/non\u2011occurrence constraints) and U_{\u2022} is a small d_\u2022\u2011ball.\n\nProposition L (Bridgeless is dense in (X,d_new) for \u0394\u2264D). For any nonempty open V=\u03c0^{-1}(O_Z)\u2229U_{\u2022}, there exists (G,\u03c1)\u2208V that is bridgeless.\nProof. Choose any unrooted G_Z\u2208Y with Occ(G_Z)\u2208O_Z satisfying the conclusion of Lemma J (this is possible since O_Z projects to a nonempty basic open in Y). Choose a root \u03c1 in a region unaffected by the surgery (outside the finite d_\u2022 core used to define U_{\u2022}) so that d_\u2022\u2011closeness to the center point holds. Then (G_Z,\u03c1)\u2208V and G_Z is bridgeless.\n\nProposition M (Graphs with a 1\u2011way infinite bridge are dense in (X,d_new)). Analogous to Proposition L via Lemma I.\n\nRemarks.\n- Under d_\u2022, bridgeless is nowhere dense (Theorem 14). Under d_new, it is dense (Proposition L), so the nowhere\u2011dense classification differs across these metrics. We leave open whether bridgeless is meagre or non\u2011meagre (and thus whether \u201ctypical\u201d collections differ in the comeagre sense) under d_new; X is compact Baire under d_new.\n- The same constructions adapt to the D\u2011regular odd setting by using the parity/deficit gadgets inside the d_\u2022 core and placing the global modifications outward while keeping degrees exactly D via local fillers. For even D\u2011regular, replace \u201c1\u2011way bridge\u201d by forcing a cut vertex in the densification and use Lemma H to ensure the no\u2011cut\u2011vertex set remains nowhere dense in any cylinder\u2011based topology.\n\nExamples\n\n- D=3, odd\u2011D gadget: Starting from any r\u2011ball F, parity flipper changes S by 1; ports move deficits outward; repeated pair\u2011closures reduce S\u21921, yielding a unique cross edge in any 3\u2011regular extension. The whole construction sits outside B_r, so the refined object is a rooted ball.\n- Occurrence constraints with forbidden patterns: If F\u2032_1,\u2026,F\u2032_m forbid degree\u20111 rooted balls up to radius R, then the block S (or the backbone B) can be chosen 2\u2011edge\u2011connected with girth >2R, so no forbidden rooted ball appears in the modified region; the single bridge in Lemma I need not create any degree\u20111 vertex.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing (Lemma H) is given as a sketch; a fully explicit layering and degree bookkeeping write\u2011up remains to be added (but it closely mirrors the odd\u2011D port/closure machinery, with routing of all deficit to one vertex c).\n- In propositions L\u2013M, we implicitly used that O_Z imposes finitely many (positive/negative) occurrence constraints; the constructions respect negatives via high\u2011girth design. A formal parameter selection (girth thresholds versus the radii in O_Z and U_{\u2022}) should be spelled out.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move Lemmas A\u2013B, Propositions C\u2013D to proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1.\n- Write detailed proofs of Lemma F and Proposition G with explicit layering radii and a termination measure; add the full even\u2011D Lemma H.\n- For Conjecture 2, analyze (X,d_new): decide whether B_0 or B_1 is meagre/comeagre. A viable plan is to produce a countable family of dense open sets whose intersection forces an infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected backbone (or, conversely, forces the presence of 1\u2011way bridges), and check whether these form a G_\u03b4 that is dense.\n- Consider an impossibility meta\u2011theorem: identify a broad \u201cfinite\u2011core invariance\u201d axiom for topologies on X that implies both bridgeless and 1\u2011way\u2011bridge sets are dense (hence neither typical if the space is Baire), thereby expanding the no\u2011go region for Conjecture 2 beyond cylinder\u2011based metrics."
