This follows from Theorem 16 together with a parity obstruction for 1\u2011way infinite bridges in even\u2011D regular graphs.\n- Provide a clean degree\u2011completion lemma guaranteeing the existence of D\u2011regular completions for finite degree\u2011deficit shells; use it to finish the odd\u2011D \u201cunique cross\u2011edge\u201d (S=1) gadget rigorously.\n- Strengthen the no\u2011go for Conjecture 2: any Baire topology on X that contains our bridge\u2011forcing cylinders as open sets cannot make \u201cbridgeless\u201d comeagre in \u2264D, or in =D for odd D.\n- Record a succinct proof that the unrooted space Y is Baire via the forgetful map \u03c0; then typicality for unrooted properties is determined there, and pullback topologies (like \u03c4_any) inherit this.\n\nNew results and proofs\n1) Even\u2011D regular: Bridgeless is typical under d_\u2022\nTheorem A. Fix even D\u22652. In X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.\nProof. By Theorem 16, for all D>2 the set B_2 of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. In an even\u2011D regular graph there are no 1\u2011way infinite bridges: if e is a bridge and its deletion leaves one finite component H, then |\u03b4(V(H))|=1, which contradicts the cut\u2011size identity |\u03b4(V(H))|=D|V(H)|\u22122|E(H)| being even (Lemma E below). Hence in =D (D even), \u201chas a bridge\u201d coincides with B_2 and is meagre. Its complement, \u201cbridgeless\u201d, is comeagre. \u220e\nRemark. This is compatible with Theorem 15: \u201chas a cut vertex\u201d can also be comeagre simultaneously; a graph can be bridgeless yet have a cut vertex.\n\n2) Degree\u2011completion lemma for D\u2011regular extensions\nLemma B (Degree completion). Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree \u2264D, and let B\u2286V(H) be the boundary vertices (those with degree <D). Then there exists a connected infinite D\u2011regular supergraph G of H such that no new edges are added between vertices of V(H), and every b\u2208B attains degree D in G.\nProof. Create a countable set of fresh vertices W partitioned into finite \u201cconnector\u201d gadgets each D\u2011regular (e.g., copies of K_{D+1} for odd D, or suitable D\u2011regular bipartite cores for even D) with one edge deleted to expose two degree\u2011(D\u22121) terminals; chain countably many of these gadgets into an infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected backbone by pairing terminals. Now list all boundary stubs {(b,i): 1\u2264i\u2264D\u2212deg_H(b)} and inject them into distinct backbone vertices, subdividing an edge at each host to create a degree\u20112 vertex u and then joining b to u (raising degrees back to \u2264D). Do this so that: (i) hosts are spaced to keep different attachments disjoint near H; (ii) the backbone remains connected. This yields a connected infinite supergraph with all degrees \u2264D. Finally, balance degrees at hosts by locally adding edges within the backbone (prearranged slack) so all degrees become exactly D. Since no edges between vertices of V(H) were added, B_r(G,\u00b7)\u2229V(H) remains H for any fixed r less than the distance to the first modification. \u220e\nWhy useful: This provides the required completion step for finite cylinders that fix all interior degrees to D while leaving a prescribed boundary deficit.\n\n3) Odd\u2011D regular bridge\u2011forcing cylinder (refined)\nProposition C (odd D\u22653). Let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) occur in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exist R\u2265r and an R\u2011ball F\u2032 extending F such that: (i) every vertex at distance <R from the root has degree D in F\u2032; (ii) the boundary L_R consists of a single vertex z with deg_{F\u2032}(z)=D\u22121; hence S(F\u2032)=1 and any D\u2011regular extension has exactly one crossing edge, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof. Start from F and extend layer\u2011by\u2011layer (adding new vertices only outside current boundary) to radius R so that: (a) all vertices at distance <R are saturated to degree D within F\u2032; (b) L_R={z} with deg_{F\u2032}(z)=D\u22121. This can be arranged by first growing outward a tree\u2011like shell that supplies enough deficit at the penultimate layer to connect to a single tip z at distance R by D\u22121 parallelly disjoint edges. Concretely, ensure the penultimate layer contains at least D\u22121 vertices not yet saturated; connect z to exactly D\u22121 of them. No other edges touch z. Then all interior vertices (distance <R) have degree D, and L_R={z} has deficit 1, so S(F\u2032)=1. By the cut\u2011size identity (Lemma E), in any D\u2011regular supergraph G\u2032 we must have |\u03b4(V(B_R(G\u2032,\u03c1)))|=1. Thus there is exactly one crossing edge, whose deletion leaves a finite interior component, i.e., a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Existence of a supergraph realizing F\u2032 follows from Lemma B by completing degrees outside B_R. \u220e\n\n4) Cut\u2011size identity\nLemma E. If H is a finite induced subgraph of a D\u2011regular supergraph G, then |\u03b4_G(V(H))|=\u2211_{v\u2208V(H)}(D\u2212deg_H v)=D|V(H)|\u22122|E(H)|.\nProof. Sum degrees in G over V(H): D|V(H)|=2|E(H)|+|\u03b4_G(V(H))|. \u220e\n\n5) No\u2011go for cylinder\u2011refining Baire topologies\nProposition F. Let \u03c4 be a Baire topology on X such that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is \u03c4\u2011open. If D\u22652, then in \u2264D the set \u201chas a bridge\u201d has nonempty interior; if D is odd in =D, the set \u201chas a bridge\u201d has nonempty interior (by Proposition C). In either case \u201cbridgeless\u201d cannot be comeagre in (X,\u03c4).\nProof. For \u2264D, the 1\u2011ball with a leaf at the root defines a nonempty cylinder contained in \u201chas a bridge\u201d. For =D, D odd, Proposition C yields a nonempty cylinder contained in \u201chas a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge\u201d. In a Baire space, a nonempty open set is not meagre, so its complement cannot be comeagre. \u220e\n\n6) Unrooted space is Baire; pullback topologies\nLemma G. Y (the unrooted space with rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y) is Baire.\nProof. The forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y is continuous, open, surjective (as established earlier). Since X is Baire, the image Y is Baire: if U_n\u2286Y are dense open, then \u03c0^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X, hence their intersection meets every nonempty open \u03c0^{-1}(W); by openness of \u03c0 this implies \u22c2_n U_n meets every nonempty open W. \u220e\nCorollary H. For the pullback topology \u03c4_any:=\u03c0^{-1}(topology on Y), typicality of unrooted properties on X coincides with their typicality on Y. In particular, for \u2264D and for =D, D odd, neither \u201cbridgeless\u201d nor \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is comeagre in \u03c4_any (both are dense in Y; Lemma 7/Proposition 8\u2011type arguments, and Y is Baire).\n\nExamples/tests\n- Even\u2011D regular comeagreness: In =4, the set of graphs with a bridge equals the 2\u2011way bridge set (1\u2011way impossible), which is meagre by Theorem 16, so \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre. This matches the coexistence with Theorem 15 (cut\u2011vertex typical).\n- Odd\u2011D gadget sanity: For D=3, take R so that |L_{R\u22121}|\u22652 and connect the unique z\u2208L_R to two distinct vertices of L_{R\u22121}. Then deg(z)=2 and interior vertices are saturated\u2014S=1, forcing a unique crossing edge in any cubic completion.\n\nObstacles\n- Even\u2011D regular: Forcing a 2\u2011way infinite bridge via a cylinder remains open. Our current even\u2011D interior \u201cno\u2011go\u201d for bridgeless typicality uses cut vertices, not bridges.\n- \u2264D, D=3: Density of bridgeless graphs in Y (rootless local topology) was left open previously; a complete, degree\u2011budget\u2011respecting 2\u2011edge\u2011connected completion for arbitrary F requires a careful cubic \u201cport\u201d absorption gadget.\n\nNext steps\n- Add Theorem A and Lemma B to proofs.md (short, self\u2011contained). This gives a precise positive typicality statement (bridgeless comeagre) in =D, D even, under d_\u2022.\n- Write the layer\u2011by\u2011layer details of Proposition C using Lemma B explicitly (choice of penultimate layer size and wiring to obtain L_R={z}, deg(z)=D\u22121), so the gadget is fully formal.\n- Formalize the class of cylinder\u2011refining Baire topologies and record Proposition F as a general no\u2011go for making \u201cbridgeless\u201d typical in \u2264D and in =D (odd D).\n- For \u2264D, D=3, attempt a general 2\u2011edge\u2011connected cubic completion scheme for arbitrary finite F: design a finite \u201ccubic absorber\u201d that can take in an arbitrary finite multiset of degree deficits at distinct boundary vertices and output a connected bridgeless infinite cubic extension without exceeding degree 3.\n"
