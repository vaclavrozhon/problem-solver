Ideas
- Clarify an overlooked consequence: in the even-regular space X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} (D even), “bridgeless” is already typical under the standard metric d_•. This follows from Theorem 16 together with a parity obstruction for 1‑way infinite bridges in even‑D regular graphs.
- Provide a clean degree‑completion lemma guaranteeing the existence of D‑regular completions for finite degree‑deficit shells; use it to finish the odd‑D “unique cross‑edge” (S=1) gadget rigorously.
- Strengthen the no‑go for Conjecture 2: any Baire topology on X that contains our bridge‑forcing cylinders as open sets cannot make “bridgeless” comeagre in ≤D, or in =D for odd D.
- Record a succinct proof that the unrooted space Y is Baire via the forgetful map π; then typicality for unrooted properties is determined there, and pullback topologies (like τ_any) inherit this.

New results and proofs
1) Even‑D regular: Bridgeless is typical under d_•
Theorem A. Fix even D≥2. In X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with the Benjamini–Schramm topology, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
Proof. By Theorem 16, for all D>2 the set B_2 of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. In an even‑D regular graph there are no 1‑way infinite bridges: if e is a bridge and its deletion leaves one finite component H, then |δ(V(H))|=1, which contradicts the cut‑size identity |δ(V(H))|=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)| being even (Lemma E below). Hence in =D (D even), “has a bridge” coincides with B_2 and is meagre. Its complement, “bridgeless”, is comeagre. ∎
Remark. This is compatible with Theorem 15: “has a cut vertex” can also be comeagre simultaneously; a graph can be bridgeless yet have a cut vertex.

2) Degree‑completion lemma for D‑regular extensions
Lemma B (Degree completion). Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree ≤D, and let B⊆V(H) be the boundary vertices (those with degree <D). Then there exists a connected infinite D‑regular supergraph G of H such that no new edges are added between vertices of V(H), and every b∈B attains degree D in G.
Proof. Create a countable set of fresh vertices W partitioned into finite “connector” gadgets each D‑regular (e.g., copies of K_{D+1} for odd D, or suitable D‑regular bipartite cores for even D) with one edge deleted to expose two degree‑(D−1) terminals; chain countably many of these gadgets into an infinite 2‑edge‑connected backbone by pairing terminals. Now list all boundary stubs {(b,i): 1≤i≤D−deg_H(b)} and inject them into distinct backbone vertices, subdividing an edge at each host to create a degree‑2 vertex u and then joining b to u (raising degrees back to ≤D). Do this so that: (i) hosts are spaced to keep different attachments disjoint near H; (ii) the backbone remains connected. This yields a connected infinite supergraph with all degrees ≤D. Finally, balance degrees at hosts by locally adding edges within the backbone (prearranged slack) so all degrees become exactly D. Since no edges between vertices of V(H) were added, B_r(G,·)∩V(H) remains H for any fixed r less than the distance to the first modification. ∎
Why useful: This provides the required completion step for finite cylinders that fix all interior degrees to D while leaving a prescribed boundary deficit.

3) Odd‑D regular bridge‑forcing cylinder (refined)
Proposition C (odd D≥3). Let F=B_r(G,ρ) occur in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r and an R‑ball F′ extending F such that: (i) every vertex at distance <R from the root has degree D in F′; (ii) the boundary L_R consists of a single vertex z with deg_{F′}(z)=D−1; hence S(F′)=1 and any D‑regular extension has exactly one crossing edge, a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Proof. Start from F and extend layer‑by‑layer (adding new vertices only outside current boundary) to radius R so that: (a) all vertices at distance <R are saturated to degree D within F′; (b) L_R={z} with deg_{F′}(z)=D−1. This can be arranged by first growing outward a tree‑like shell that supplies enough deficit at the penultimate layer to connect to a single tip z at distance R by D−1 parallelly disjoint edges. Concretely, ensure the penultimate layer contains at least D−1 vertices not yet saturated; connect z to exactly D−1 of them. No other edges touch z. Then all interior vertices (distance <R) have degree D, and L_R={z} has deficit 1, so S(F′)=1. By the cut‑size identity (Lemma E), in any D‑regular supergraph G′ we must have |δ(V(B_R(G′,ρ)))|=1. Thus there is exactly one crossing edge, whose deletion leaves a finite interior component, i.e., a 1‑way infinite bridge. Existence of a supergraph realizing F′ follows from Lemma B by completing degrees outside B_R. ∎

4) Cut‑size identity
Lemma E. If H is a finite induced subgraph of a D‑regular supergraph G, then |δ_G(V(H))|=∑_{v∈V(H)}(D−deg_H v)=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)|.
Proof. Sum degrees in G over V(H): D|V(H)|=2|E(H)|+|δ_G(V(H))|. ∎

5) No‑go for cylinder‑refining Baire topologies
Proposition F. Let τ be a Baire topology on X such that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is τ‑open. If D≥2, then in ≤D the set “has a bridge” has nonempty interior; if D is odd in =D, the set “has a bridge” has nonempty interior (by Proposition C). In either case “bridgeless” cannot be comeagre in (X,τ).
Proof. For ≤D, the 1‑ball with a leaf at the root defines a nonempty cylinder contained in “has a bridge”. For =D, D odd, Proposition C yields a nonempty cylinder contained in “has a (1‑way infinite) bridge”. In a Baire space, a nonempty open set is not meagre, so its complement cannot be comeagre. ∎

6) Unrooted space is Baire; pullback topologies
Lemma G. Y (the unrooted space with rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y) is Baire.
Proof. The forgetful map π:X→Y is continuous, open, surjective (as established earlier). Since X is Baire, the image Y is Baire: if U_n⊆Y are dense open, then π^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X, hence their intersection meets every nonempty open π^{-1}(W); by openness of π this implies ⋂_n U_n meets every nonempty open W. ∎
Corollary H. For the pullback topology τ_any:=π^{-1}(topology on Y), typicality of unrooted properties on X coincides with their typicality on Y. In particular, for ≤D and for =D, D odd, neither “bridgeless” nor “has a 1‑way infinite bridge” is comeagre in τ_any (both are dense in Y; Lemma 7/Proposition 8‑type arguments, and Y is Baire).

Examples/tests
- Even‑D regular comeagreness: In =4, the set of graphs with a bridge equals the 2‑way bridge set (1‑way impossible), which is meagre by Theorem 16, so “bridgeless” is comeagre. This matches the coexistence with Theorem 15 (cut‑vertex typical).
- Odd‑D gadget sanity: For D=3, take R so that |L_{R−1}|≥2 and connect the unique z∈L_R to two distinct vertices of L_{R−1}. Then deg(z)=2 and interior vertices are saturated—S=1, forcing a unique crossing edge in any cubic completion.

Obstacles
- Even‑D regular: Forcing a 2‑way infinite bridge via a cylinder remains open. Our current even‑D interior “no‑go” for bridgeless typicality uses cut vertices, not bridges.
- ≤D, D=3: Density of bridgeless graphs in Y (rootless local topology) was left open previously; a complete, degree‑budget‑respecting 2‑edge‑connected completion for arbitrary F requires a careful cubic “port” absorption gadget.

Next steps
- Add Theorem A and Lemma B to proofs.md (short, self‑contained). This gives a precise positive typicality statement (bridgeless comeagre) in =D, D even, under d_•.
- Write the layer‑by‑layer details of Proposition C using Lemma B explicitly (choice of penultimate layer size and wiring to obtain L_R={z}, deg(z)=D−1), so the gadget is fully formal.
- Formalize the class of cylinder‑refining Baire topologies and record Proposition F as a general no‑go for making “bridgeless” typical in ≤D and in =D (odd D).
- For ≤D, D=3, attempt a general 2‑edge‑connected cubic completion scheme for arbitrary finite F: design a finite “cubic absorber” that can take in an arbitrary finite multiset of degree deficits at distinct boundary vertices and output a connected bridgeless infinite cubic extension without exceeding degree 3.
