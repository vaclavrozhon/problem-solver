Together with the finite-lens property (FLP) results, this isolates the search to genuinely nonlocal metrics.\\n- Provide clean, explicit odd-D and even-D gadgets and a uniform \u201cfinite pinning property\u201d (FPP) criterion under which the nowhere-denseness proofs go through.\\n\\nLemmas and proofs\\n\\n- Setup. X=\ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,D} with Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology \u03c4_\u2022. Y=unrooted connected countable graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) with the rootless-local topology \u03c4\u2080 generated by U_F^Y={G\u2208Y: \u2203v with B_r(G,v)\u2245F} for rooted r-balls F.\\n\\nLemma 1 (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective; Y is Baire).\\nLet \u03c0:X\u2192Y be \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G. Then \u03c0 is continuous since \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{F\u2032 rootings of F} \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{F\u2032} is open in \u03c4_\u2022; \u03c0 is open because \u03c0(\ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{F\u2032})=U_F^Y and extends by unions. Since (X,\u03c4_\u2022) is Baire, Y is Baire as the continuous open image of a Baire space (e.g., Oxtoby\u2019s theorem).\\nWhy useful: Establishes a robust ambient Baire framework for unrooted typicality.\\n\\nProposition 2 (Root-invariance via \u03c0-transfer).\\nFor any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080) iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4_\u2022). If A has the Baire property (BP) in \u03c4\u2080 (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\\nProof sketch: Continuity/openness of \u03c0 yield int(cl(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(int(cl(A))). For meagreness, use dense G_\u03b4 witness sets and \u03c0\u2019s openness.\\nWhy useful: Resolves Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (all A) and meagreness (BP sets).\\n\\nDefinition (FLP and FPP on X).\\n- FLP (finite-lens property): every open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) pinning radius-r neighborhoods around finitely many marked vertices.\\n- FPP (finite pinning property): every open O contains some FLP-cylinder W(M) with W(M)\u2286O.\\nThese cover Benjamini\u2013Schramm, k-lens, and finite-intersection-of-cylinders metrics.\\n\\nTheorem 3 (Bridgeless nowhere dense under FLP; \u2264D and =D odd).\\nLet D\u22653. In any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D}, BrFree is nowhere dense. In any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D} with odd D, BrFree is nowhere dense.\\nProof (\u2264D): Inside any W(M), pick a boundary vertex b with residual capacity and pin a new leaf z adjacent only to b (all within the pinned finite region). Then bz is a bridge in every completion, so W(M) contains an open subset disjoint from BrFree.\\nProof (=D odd): Use the explicit finite seed S: start from K_{D+2} with vertices x,a,b,W (|W|=D\u22121). Delete xa,xb and a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D\u22121, others D. Pin the full radius-1 neighborhoods of S far from the marks. In any D-regular completion, only x has residual capacity, forcing exactly one cross edge incident with x; hence that edge is a bridge. Thus BrFree is nowhere dense.\\n\\nProposition 4 (Even-D regular: NoCut nowhere dense under FLP/FPP).\\nFor even D\u22654, in any FLP (hence FPP) metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D}, the set NoCut (graphs without a cut vertex) is nowhere dense. Explicit gadget: from K_{D,D} on A\u222aB, select x\u2208A,y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B; remove x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082 and add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Only x has deficit 2; in any completion all cross edges attach to x, making x a cut vertex.\\nWhy useful: Complements Theorem 3 in the even-regular regime.\\n\\nProposition 5 (Unrooted: BrFree is nowhere dense in Y for \u2264D and =D odd).\\nIn (Y,\u03c4\u2080) with \u0394\u2264D, BrFree is nowhere dense; likewise in \u0394= D with odd D.\\nProof. Given U_F^Y, refine to U_{F\u2032}^Y by embedding the same pinned gadgets wholly inside the r\u2032-ball F\u2032, far from its center, ensuring the presence of a bridge in every completion. This does not depend on the root, so the rooted arguments transfer to Y.\\nCorollary 5.1. In the occurrence pullback topology \u03c4_occ on X generated by sets Occ(F)=\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y), BrFree is nowhere dense; hence no such \u201coccurrence-based\u201d coarser natural metric can make BrFree typical.\\n\\nLemma 6 (Bounded re-rooting invariance for section metrics).\\nIf s,t:Y\u2192X are root selectors with dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism and typicality is preserved.\\nWhy useful: Robustness across canonical root choices.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Odd D=3, seed S: In K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w\u2081,w\u2082, remove xa,xb,w\u2081w\u2082. Pinning S forces exactly one external edge at x in any 3-regular completion, hence a bridge.\\n- Even D=4, cut-vertex gadget: In K_{4,4}, remove x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082, add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082. Pin. All external edges must attach at x, making x a cut vertex.\\n\\nConsequences and no-go region (for Conjecture 2)\\n\\n- Under any topology on X with FPP (in particular, all cylinder-based and finite-lens metrics), BrFree is nowhere dense in \u2264D and in =D with odd D; for even D regular, NoCut is nowhere dense. Thus typicality cannot flip within this broad local class. By refinement monotonicity, any finer metric also preserves nowhere-denseness.\\n- At the unrooted level (Y,\u03c4\u2080), BrFree is nowhere dense and Y is Baire. Pullbacks (\u03c4_occ) inherit the obstruction.\\n\\nObstacles and cautions\\n\\n- A metric making BrFree typical must be strictly outside FPP/FLP and cannot be finer than Benjamini\u2013Schramm. Constructing such a \u201cnatural\u201d metric on rooted graphs that remains Baire is nontrivial.\\n- While graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense in \u03c4\u2080 (easy local surgery away from a prescribed finite ball), we did not claim bridgeless density in \u03c4\u2080 because cylinders can be refined to force S(F\u2032)=1, precluding bridgeless completions.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Promote Lemma 1, Propositions 2, 5 to proofs.md, settling Conjecture 1 (ND for all sets; meagre for BP sets) and extending nowhere-denseness of BrFree to unrooted Y.\\n- Record Theorem 3 and Proposition 4 with explicit pinning (radius-1) and degree-capacity arguments; include the parity check that |\u03b4(S)|=1 in the odd-D gadget.\\n- Identify candidate non-FPP metrics on rooted graphs that remain Baire (e.g., occurrence-frequency or end-structure metrics), and test whether BrFree can be comeagre there; provide either constructions or impossibility lemmas.\\n- For even D regular, complement NoCut with an explicit analysis of 2-way infinite bridges\u2019 category under FLP/FPP at the unrooted level, paralleling Theorem 16.\\n\"}",
