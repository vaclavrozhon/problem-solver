This resolves Conjecture 1 for all natural properties (Borel/analytic) and records the correct scope.\\n- Close the even\u2011D regular gap by a clean, finite, degree\u2011completion gadget that forces a cut vertex at the root in every D\u2011regular completion, complementing the odd\u2011D parity gadget (\u03b4=1) for bridges.\\n- Extend the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d region in Conjecture 2 by analyzing a natural shifted\u2011root metric d_shift; prove it is a metric, cylinders remain open, so bridgeless stays nowhere dense. Provide a tail\u2011type topology observation where both bridgeful and bridgeless have nonempty interior; if Baire, neither can be comeagre.\\n\\nQuotient framework: root\u2011invariance of smallness (Conjecture 1)\\n\\nLet X=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology and Y be the space of unrooted connected countable graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) with the rootless\u2011local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y be \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\\n\\nLemma 1 (\u03c0 is open quotient). \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective; Y carries the quotient topology: U\u2286Y is open iff \u03c0^{-1}(U) is open.\\nProof. For any rooted r\u2011ball F, \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{v} \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{(F,v)} is open; every open in X is a union of cylinders whose images are rootless cylinders, establishing openness. Surjectivity is clear.\\n\\nLemma 2 (closure transport). For all A\u2286Y, \u03c0^{-1}(\\\\overline{A}^Y)=\\\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X.\\nProof. In quotient spaces, C\u2286Y is closed iff \u03c0^{-1}(C) is closed; intersecting over all closed C\u2287A yields the identity.\\n\\nTheorem 3 (nowhere\u2011dense equivalence). A\u2286Y is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\\nProof. If A is nowhere dense, int_Y(\\\\overline{A}^Y)=\u2205. If U\u2286X is nonempty open with U\u2286\\\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X, then \u03c0(U) is nonempty open in Y (Lemma 1) and \u03c0(U)\u2286\\\\overline{A}^Y (Lemma 2), contradicting emptiness of interior. The converse is symmetric.\\n\\nCorollary 4 (meagreness equivalence for Baire\u2011property sets). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\\nProof. (\u21d2) Preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then \u2203 nonempty open V\u2286Y with A\u2229V comeagre in V. Write V\\\\(A\u2229V)\u2286\u22c3 N_i with N_i nowhere dense. In \u03c0^{-1}(V), the sets \u03c0^{-1}(N_i) are nowhere dense (Theorem 3), so \u03c0^{-1}(A\u2229V)=\u03c0^{-1}(V)\\\\\u22c3 \u03c0^{-1}(N_i) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of \u03c0^{-1}(A).\\n\\nLemma 5 (Y is Baire). Y is Baire.\\nProof. If Y were meagre, Y=\u22c3 N_i with N_i nowhere dense. Then X=\u22c3 \u03c0^{-1}(N_i) with \u03c0^{-1}(N_i) nowhere dense (Theorem 3), contradicting that X is Baire (standard for BS spaces with degree bound). Alternatively, open continuous surjections map Baire spaces to Baire spaces.\\n\\nConsequences. Conjecture 1 holds for all properties whose unrooted sets are Baire\u2011measurable (e.g., Borel/analytic): smallness (nowhere\u2011dense, meagre) of S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(A_P) is root\u2011invariant.\\n\\nEven\u2011D regular cut\u2011vertex forcing (closing the gadget gap)\\n\\nWe work in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D\u22654. For a finite rooted ball F with boundary L, let f_F(v)=D\u2212deg_F(v) for v\u2208L and \u03b4(F)=\u03a3 f_F(v).\\n\\nLemma 6 (finite degree completion preserving an induced core). Let D\u22652 and H be a finite induced subgraph with deg_H(v)\u2264t(v)\u2264D for v\u2208V(H). Then there exists a finite simple graph J\u2287H with H induced in J and deg_J(v)=t(v) for v\u2208V(H), and deg_J(u)\u2264D for u\u2208V(J)\\\\V(H).\\nProof sketch. Let s(v)=t(v)\u2212deg_H(v) and S=\u03a3 s(v). Add T\u226bS new vertices W. Attach to each v exactly s(v) distinct neighbors in W. Now complete degrees on W to \u2264D by choosing a simple D\u2032\u2011regular graph on W (Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai criterion) after accounting for the initial attachments; for large T one can satisfy parity and degree constraints. H remains induced.\\n\\nProposition 7 (forcing a cut vertex at the root). For even D\u22654, given any rooted r\u2011ball F in a D\u2011regular graph (oddity irrelevant here), there exists a finite extension F* so that: (i) all vertices except the root \u03c1 have degree D within F*; (ii) deg_{F*}(\u03c1)=D\u22122. Hence \u03b4(F*)=2 concentrated at \u03c1. In any D\u2011regular extension G, the only edges leaving F* are two edges incident to \u03c1, making \u03c1 a cut vertex.\\nProof. Enlarge F within finitely many steps (by adding vertices/edges beyond the current boundary) to a finite induced H containing B_r with deg_H(\u03c1)=D\u22122 and deg_H(u)\u2264D for u\u2260\u03c1. Apply Lemma 6 with t(\u03c1)=D\u22122 and t(u)=D (u\u2260\u03c1) to obtain J with H induced and the stated degrees. Let F* be a rooted ball of J covering H. Boundary deficits vanish except at \u03c1 where f(\u03c1)=2. In any D\u2011regular extension, cross edges equal \u03b4(F*)=2 and must be incident to \u03c1, whence \u03c1 separates V(F*)\\\\{\u03c1} from the infinite remainder.\\n\\nRemark. Together with the odd\u2011D parity gadget (iterated Q_D=K_{D+1}\u2212e attachments reduce \u03b4 to 1), this completes the uniform forcing schemes needed in Theorems 14\u201315 and shows they are root\u2011invariant under any cylinder\u2011based topology.\\n\\nA natural shifted\u2011root metric and an extended no\u2011go (Conjecture 2)\\n\\nDefine, for 0<\u03b1<1, the shifted\u2011root metric on X by\\n\\nd_shift((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3)) = inf{ \u03b1^{k+\\\\ell} + d_\\\\bullet((G,\u03c1'),(H,\u03c3')) : dist_G(\u03c1,\u03c1')\u2264k, dist_H(\u03c3,\u03c3')\u2264\\\\ell }.\\n\\nLemma 8. d_shift is a metric on X and refines the BS topology (all cylinders are open in d_shift).\\nProof. Symmetry is clear; d(x,x)=0 by choosing k=\\\\ell=0, and if d_shift(x,y)=0 then for every \u03b5>0 there exist \u03c1\u2032,\u03c3\u2032 with \u03b1^{k+\\\\ell}<\u03b5 and d_\\\\bullet((G,\u03c1\u2032),(H,\u03c3\u2032))<\u03b5, forcing isomorphism of all finite rooted balls at (G,\u03c1\u2032),(H,\u03c3\u2032) and hence (G,\u03c1)\u2245(H,\u03c3) by shifting back finitely many steps iteratively; thus x=y. Triangle inequality: given x,y,z, choose witnesses (\u03c1\u2032,\u03c3\u2032),(\u03c3\u2033,\u03c4\u2032) close to y with penalties \u03b1^{k1+\\\\ell1}, \u03b1^{k2+\\\\ell2}; pass to a common re\u2011rooting of y at \u03c3* within distance \u2264max(\\\\ell1,k2), and use the ultrametric inequality of d_\\\\bullet to bound d_shift(x,z) by \u03b1^{k1+\\\\ell1}+\u03b1^{k2+\\\\ell2}+d_\\\\bullet((G,\u03c1\u2032),(K,\u03c4\u2032)), then inf over witnesses. Finally, cylinders are open since choosing k=\\\\ell=0 gives d_shift\u2264d_\\\\bullet.\\n\\nCorollary 9 (no\u2011go extension). In (X,d_shift), the set of bridgeless graphs remains nowhere dense (degree\u2011bounded and odd\u2011D regular cases), by the same cylinder\u2011refinement forcing as in Theorems 14\u201315.\\n\\nA tail\u2011type topology where both interiors are nonempty\\n\\nDefine \u03c4_tail on X by the base U_R(G,\u03c1) of all (H,\u03c3) whose complements outside B_R are root\u2011preserving isomorphic with boundary spheres identified. Then:\\n\\nObservation 10. Both the sets {has a bridge} and {bridgeless} have nonempty interior in \u03c4_tail.\\nProof. If an edge e lies outside B_R(G,\u03c1) and is a bridge in G, then every (H,\u03c3)\u2208U_R(G,\u03c1) inherits a corresponding bridge; hence U_R(G,\u03c1)\u2286{bridgeful}. Conversely, if the outside G\\\\B_R(G,\u03c1) is 2\u2011edge\u2011connected, then U_R(G,\u03c1)\u2286{bridgeless}.\\n\\nConditional corollary. If (X,\u03c4_tail) is Baire (open to prove), neither set is comeagre; in particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical there.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- D=3 (odd): Starting from any cylinder F, iterative attachments of Q_3=K_4\u2212e reduce \u03b4 to 1; any 3\u2011regular completion has exactly one cross edge, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\\n- D=4 (even): Using Proposition 7, refine any cylinder to force deg(\u03c1)=2 inside the refined finite ball and saturate all others to degree 4; every 4\u2011regular completion has all cross edges at \u03c1, a cut vertex.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Meagreness transfer beyond Baire\u2011property sets can fail for general quotient maps; we restrict to Baire\u2011property sets (sufficient for all natural properties considered).\\n- \u03c4_tail: proving Baire\u2011ness (or metrization) is pending. A route is to encode \u201coutsides beyond R\u201d into compact BS\u2011type spaces with finitely many distinguished boundary vertices and to represent \u03c4_tail as the final topology of a continuous open map into a product of such compacta.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Insert Lemmas 1\u20132, Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Lemma 5 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 (correct scope and proofs).\\n- Add Lemma 6 and Proposition 7 (even\u2011D gadget) with full details and references (Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai) to proofs.md; this strengthens the uniform forcing arguments.\\n- Formalize d_shift: include a complete triangle inequality proof via \u03b5\u2011witnesses and an explicit bound; record that cylinders are open and typicality is unchanged.\\n- Analyze \u03c4_tail rigorously: construct the \u201coutside\u201d compact spaces with boundary; prove (or refute) Baire\u2011ness. If Baire, Observation 10 rules out bridgeless typicality under \u03c4_tail, answering a negative instance of Conjecture 2.\\n\"}",
