Ideas

- Consolidate Conjecture 1 with rigorous quotient‑map arguments: (i) equivalence of nowhere‑denseness via π, (ii) meagreness equivalence for Baire‑property sets, and (iii) Y is a Baire space. This resolves Conjecture 1 for all natural properties (Borel/analytic) and records the correct scope.
- Close the even‑D regular gap by a clean, finite, degree‑completion gadget that forces a cut vertex at the root in every D‑regular completion, complementing the odd‑D parity gadget (δ=1) for bridges.
- Extend the “no‑go” region in Conjecture 2 by analyzing a natural shifted‑root metric d_shift; prove it is a metric, cylinders remain open, so bridgeless stays nowhere dense. Provide a tail‑type topology observation where both bridgeful and bridgeless have nonempty interior; if Baire, neither can be comeagre.

Quotient framework: root‑invariance of smallness (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm topology and Y be the space of unrooted connected countable graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) with the rootless‑local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. Let π:X→Y be π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is open quotient). π is continuous, open, surjective; Y carries the quotient topology: U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open.
Proof. For any rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v} \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{(F,v)} is open; every open in X is a union of cylinders whose images are rootless cylinders, establishing openness. Surjectivity is clear.

Lemma 2 (closure transport). For all A⊆Y, π^{-1}(\overline{A}^Y)=\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X.
Proof. In quotient spaces, C⊆Y is closed iff π^{-1}(C) is closed; intersecting over all closed C⊇A yields the identity.

Theorem 3 (nowhere‑dense equivalence). A⊆Y is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. If A is nowhere dense, int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)=∅. If U⊆X is nonempty open with U⊆\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X, then π(U) is nonempty open in Y (Lemma 1) and π(U)⊆\overline{A}^Y (Lemma 2), contradicting emptiness of interior. The converse is symmetric.

Corollary 4 (meagreness equivalence for Baire‑property sets). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y with A∩V comeagre in V. Write V\(A∩V)⊆⋃ N_i with N_i nowhere dense. In π^{-1}(V), the sets π^{-1}(N_i) are nowhere dense (Theorem 3), so π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(V)\⋃ π^{-1}(N_i) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of π^{-1}(A).

Lemma 5 (Y is Baire). Y is Baire.
Proof. If Y were meagre, Y=⋃ N_i with N_i nowhere dense. Then X=⋃ π^{-1}(N_i) with π^{-1}(N_i) nowhere dense (Theorem 3), contradicting that X is Baire (standard for BS spaces with degree bound). Alternatively, open continuous surjections map Baire spaces to Baire spaces.

Consequences. Conjecture 1 holds for all properties whose unrooted sets are Baire‑measurable (e.g., Borel/analytic): smallness (nowhere‑dense, meagre) of S_P=π^{-1}(A_P) is root‑invariant.

Even‑D regular cut‑vertex forcing (closing the gadget gap)

We work in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4. For a finite rooted ball F with boundary L, let f_F(v)=D−deg_F(v) for v∈L and δ(F)=Σ f_F(v).

Lemma 6 (finite degree completion preserving an induced core). Let D≥2 and H be a finite induced subgraph with deg_H(v)≤t(v)≤D for v∈V(H). Then there exists a finite simple graph J⊇H with H induced in J and deg_J(v)=t(v) for v∈V(H), and deg_J(u)≤D for u∈V(J)\V(H).
Proof sketch. Let s(v)=t(v)−deg_H(v) and S=Σ s(v). Add T≫S new vertices W. Attach to each v exactly s(v) distinct neighbors in W. Now complete degrees on W to ≤D by choosing a simple D′‑regular graph on W (Erdős–Gallai criterion) after accounting for the initial attachments; for large T one can satisfy parity and degree constraints. H remains induced.

Proposition 7 (forcing a cut vertex at the root). For even D≥4, given any rooted r‑ball F in a D‑regular graph (oddity irrelevant here), there exists a finite extension F* so that: (i) all vertices except the root ρ have degree D within F*; (ii) deg_{F*}(ρ)=D−2. Hence δ(F*)=2 concentrated at ρ. In any D‑regular extension G, the only edges leaving F* are two edges incident to ρ, making ρ a cut vertex.
Proof. Enlarge F within finitely many steps (by adding vertices/edges beyond the current boundary) to a finite induced H containing B_r with deg_H(ρ)=D−2 and deg_H(u)≤D for u≠ρ. Apply Lemma 6 with t(ρ)=D−2 and t(u)=D (u≠ρ) to obtain J with H induced and the stated degrees. Let F* be a rooted ball of J covering H. Boundary deficits vanish except at ρ where f(ρ)=2. In any D‑regular extension, cross edges equal δ(F*)=2 and must be incident to ρ, whence ρ separates V(F*)\{ρ} from the infinite remainder.

Remark. Together with the odd‑D parity gadget (iterated Q_D=K_{D+1}−e attachments reduce δ to 1), this completes the uniform forcing schemes needed in Theorems 14–15 and shows they are root‑invariant under any cylinder‑based topology.

A natural shifted‑root metric and an extended no‑go (Conjecture 2)

Define, for 0<α<1, the shifted‑root metric on X by

d_shift((G,ρ),(H,σ)) = inf{ α^{k+\ell} + d_\bullet((G,ρ'),(H,σ')) : dist_G(ρ,ρ')≤k, dist_H(σ,σ')≤\ell }.

Lemma 8. d_shift is a metric on X and refines the BS topology (all cylinders are open in d_shift).
Proof. Symmetry is clear; d(x,x)=0 by choosing k=\ell=0, and if d_shift(x,y)=0 then for every ε>0 there exist ρ′,σ′ with α^{k+\ell}<ε and d_\bullet((G,ρ′),(H,σ′))<ε, forcing isomorphism of all finite rooted balls at (G,ρ′),(H,σ′) and hence (G,ρ)≅(H,σ) by shifting back finitely many steps iteratively; thus x=y. Triangle inequality: given x,y,z, choose witnesses (ρ′,σ′),(σ″,τ′) close to y with penalties α^{k1+\ell1}, α^{k2+\ell2}; pass to a common re‑rooting of y at σ* within distance ≤max(\ell1,k2), and use the ultrametric inequality of d_\bullet to bound d_shift(x,z) by α^{k1+\ell1}+α^{k2+\ell2}+d_\bullet((G,ρ′),(K,τ′)), then inf over witnesses. Finally, cylinders are open since choosing k=\ell=0 gives d_shift≤d_\bullet.

Corollary 9 (no‑go extension). In (X,d_shift), the set of bridgeless graphs remains nowhere dense (degree‑bounded and odd‑D regular cases), by the same cylinder‑refinement forcing as in Theorems 14–15.

A tail‑type topology where both interiors are nonempty

Define τ_tail on X by the base U_R(G,ρ) of all (H,σ) whose complements outside B_R are root‑preserving isomorphic with boundary spheres identified. Then:

Observation 10. Both the sets {has a bridge} and {bridgeless} have nonempty interior in τ_tail.
Proof. If an edge e lies outside B_R(G,ρ) and is a bridge in G, then every (H,σ)∈U_R(G,ρ) inherits a corresponding bridge; hence U_R(G,ρ)⊆{bridgeful}. Conversely, if the outside G\B_R(G,ρ) is 2‑edge‑connected, then U_R(G,ρ)⊆{bridgeless}.

Conditional corollary. If (X,τ_tail) is Baire (open to prove), neither set is comeagre; in particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical there.

Examples

- D=3 (odd): Starting from any cylinder F, iterative attachments of Q_3=K_4−e reduce δ to 1; any 3‑regular completion has exactly one cross edge, a 1‑way infinite bridge.
- D=4 (even): Using Proposition 7, refine any cylinder to force deg(ρ)=2 inside the refined finite ball and saturate all others to degree 4; every 4‑regular completion has all cross edges at ρ, a cut vertex.

Obstacles

- Meagreness transfer beyond Baire‑property sets can fail for general quotient maps; we restrict to Baire‑property sets (sufficient for all natural properties considered).
- τ_tail: proving Baire‑ness (or metrization) is pending. A route is to encode “outsides beyond R” into compact BS‑type spaces with finitely many distinguished boundary vertices and to represent τ_tail as the final topology of a continuous open map into a product of such compacta.

Next steps

- Insert Lemmas 1–2, Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Lemma 5 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 (correct scope and proofs).
- Add Lemma 6 and Proposition 7 (even‑D gadget) with full details and references (Erdős–Gallai) to proofs.md; this strengthens the uniform forcing arguments.
- Formalize d_shift: include a complete triangle inequality proof via ε‑witnesses and an explicit bound; record that cylinders are open and typicality is unchanged.
- Analyze τ_tail rigorously: construct the “outside” compact spaces with boundary; prove (or refute) Baire‑ness. If Baire, Observation 10 rules out bridgeless typicality under τ_tail, answering a negative instance of Conjecture 2.
