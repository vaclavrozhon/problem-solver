Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved nowhere\u2011denseness transfers exactly between unrooted and rooted spaces; meagreness also transfers for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no\u2011go for any metric whose base is the rooted cylinders (it induces the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved). We built explicit gadgets: an odd\u2011D parity refinement forcing a single outgoing edge (hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every D\u2011regular completion) and an even\u2011D refinement forcing a cut vertex; from this we deduced that bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D when D is even (D\u22654). We proposed a coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) where 1\u2011way bridges are dense; its Baire/Polish status and the category of bridgeless vs bridged there remain open.\",\"highlights\":[\"Conjecture 1 resolved: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space \u21d4 its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets (Borel/analytic).\",\"Main tool: forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y is continuous, open and surjective, giving exact category transfer between rooted and unrooted spaces.\",\"Cylinder\u2011based metrics are powerless: any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so typicality cannot change under such metrics (no\u2011go).\",\"Odd D\u22653: constructed parity gadget producing F\u2032 with S(F\u2032)=1, forcing a unique outgoing edge and thus a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every D\u2011regular completion.\",\"Even D\u22654: constructed a refinement forcing a vertex of degree D\u22122 (all others D) so that in any D\u2011regular completion that vertex is a cut vertex; deduced bridgeless is comeagre in =D for even D.\",\"Coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) changes density behavior (1\u2011way bridges dense), but its Baire/Polish status and typicality consequences remain open.\",\"Sources: Working log \u2014 Conjectures 1 and 2; Proofs (rigorous proofs); \u0160\u00e1mal & Zamani (EUROCOMB\u201925 extended abstract).\"],\"next_questions\":[\"Formalize the d_any topology precisely, prove or disprove it is a Baire (or Polish) space, and classify the category (meagre/comeagre) of bridgeless vs bridged sets there.\",\"Finish and polish write\u2011up of \u03c0\u2011based proofs and the odd\u2011D / even\u2011D gadget constructions (proofs.md) and verify all embedding/realizability details.\",\"Check remaining natural non\u2011cylinder metrics (section/choice metrics, bounded re\u2011rooting) for corner cases and confirm no other natural metric can alter typicality.\"]}",
