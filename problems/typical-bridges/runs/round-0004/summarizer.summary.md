Last round: Conjecture 1 was settled. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly between unrooted and rooted spaces; meagreness also transfers for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go for any metric whose base is the rooted cylinders (it induces the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved). We built explicit gadgets: an odd‑D parity refinement forcing a single outgoing edge (hence a 1‑way infinite bridge in every D‑regular completion) and an even‑D refinement forcing a cut vertex; from this we deduced that bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D when D is even (D≥4). We proposed a coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) where 1‑way bridges are dense; its Baire/Polish status and the category of bridgeless vs bridged there remain open.
