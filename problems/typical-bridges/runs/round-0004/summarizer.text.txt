{"summary_md":"Last round: Conjecture 1 was settled. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly between unrooted and rooted spaces; meagreness also transfers for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go for any metric whose base is the rooted cylinders (it induces the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved). We built explicit gadgets: an odd‑D parity refinement forcing a single outgoing edge (hence a 1‑way infinite bridge in every D‑regular completion) and an even‑D refinement forcing a cut vertex; from this we deduced that bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D when D is even (D≥4). We proposed a coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) where 1‑way bridges are dense; its Baire/Polish status and the category of bridgeless vs bridged there remain open.","highlights":["Conjecture 1 resolved: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space ⇔ its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets (Borel/analytic).","Main tool: forgetful map π:X→Y is continuous, open and surjective, giving exact category transfer between rooted and unrooted spaces.","Cylinder‑based metrics are powerless: any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality cannot change under such metrics (no‑go).","Odd D≥3: constructed parity gadget producing F′ with S(F′)=1, forcing a unique outgoing edge and thus a 1‑way infinite bridge in every D‑regular completion.","Even D≥4: constructed a refinement forcing a vertex of degree D−2 (all others D) so that in any D‑regular completion that vertex is a cut vertex; deduced bridgeless is comeagre in =D for even D.","Coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) changes density behavior (1‑way bridges dense), but its Baire/Polish status and typicality consequences remain open.","Sources: Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2; Proofs (rigorous proofs); Šámal & Zamani (EUROCOMB’25 extended abstract)."],"next_questions":["Formalize the d_any topology precisely, prove or disprove it is a Baire (or Polish) space, and classify the category (meagre/comeagre) of bridgeless vs bridged sets there.","Finish and polish write‑up of π‑based proofs and the odd‑D / even‑D gadget constructions (proofs.md) and verify all embedding/realizability details.","Check remaining natural non‑cylinder metrics (section/choice metrics, bounded re‑rooting) for corner cases and confirm no other natural metric can alter typicality."]}
