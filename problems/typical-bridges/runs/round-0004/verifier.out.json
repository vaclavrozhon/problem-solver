  "feedback_md": "Strong consolidation this round on Conjecture 1 (via the forgetful map \u03c0) and on robust \u201cno\u2011go\u201d regimes for Conjecture 2. Highlights and issues:\n\n- \u03c0\u2011framework: Multiple provers correctly prove \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere\u2011denseness transfers equivalently between unrooted (Y) and rooted (X), and meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic). Prover 3\u2019s clean Baire proof for Y via \u03c0 is correct. Please avoid claims beyond BP: Prover 5\u2019s \u201cmeagreness for all A\u2286Y\u201d is unsubstantiated; the step \u201cA non\u2011meagre \u21d2 \u2203 open V with A\u2229V comeagre\u201d fails without BP. Keep meagreness equivalence to BP sets.\n\n- Odd\u2011D gadgets: The \u03b4=1 parity construction is now rigorous. Ensure degree caps at the new layer W and that all interior vertices are saturated to D; both the counting choice (t and e_W) and the pinned\u2011seed variant (K_{D+2} with deletions) are valid.\n\n- Even\u2011D regular: The cut\u2011vertex forcing gadgets are now correct. Additionally, Prover 3\u2019s observation is important: in =D with even D, 1\u2011way bridges are impossible by parity; Theorem 16 makes 2\u2011way bridges meagre; thus \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre. This positive typicality statement should be recorded.\n\n- Theorem 16 formalization: Prover 1\u2019s edge\u2011replacement by 2\u2011terminal 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadgets is a sound way to forbid bridges within distance \u2264k while respecting degree bounds (use disjoint \u0398 gadgets; preserve degrees at endpoints). Good to keep as the canonical proof technique.\n\n- Coarser/nonlocal topologies: Density of 1\u2011way (and in some settings 2\u2011way) bridges under root\u2011insensitive/occurrence topologies is plausible and well\u2011argued; however, do not state compact/Polish/Baire without proofs. For \u03c4_any/occurrence, Baire holds on Y; for other proposals (tail, d_any), status is open\u2014mark clearly.\n\n- Caution on new metrics: Prover 2\u2019s d_new = d_C\u2218\u03a6 + \u03b5 d_\u2022 induces the same topology as d_\u2022 (\u03a6 is continuous w.r.t. d_\u2022); it cannot change nowhere\u2011denseness/typicality. The asserted density shift for bridgeless under d_new contradicts Theorem 14 and should be retracted. Prover 5\u2019s d_shift is a cylinder\u2011based metric; typicality remains unchanged; triangle inequality needs a precise proof if kept.\n\nNext steps:\n- Finalize \u03c0\u2011based proofs (ND transfer; meagreness for BP sets) in proofs.md.\n- Add the even\u2011D regular \u201cbridgeless is comeagre\u201d theorem (parity + Theorem 16) to proofs.md and output.md.\n- Keep the odd\u2011D \u03b4=1 gadget and the even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex gadget, stated layer\u2011respectfully with degree checks, in proofs.md.\n- For a chosen coarser topology (occurrence/tail), prove Baire (or provide counterexamples) and then decide category of bridgeful/bridgeless sets.\n",
  "summary_md": "Conjecture 1 is settled for natural properties via the forgetful map \u03c0: nowhere\u2011denseness transfers exactly, and meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets. For Conjecture 2, cylinder/finite\u2011lens metrics preserve typicality; odd\u2011D bridge\u2011forcing and even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex gadgets are rigorous. New result: in D\u2011regular with even D, bridgeless graphs are comeagre (1\u2011way bridges impossible; 2\u2011way bridges meagre). Claims that a metric mixing occurrences and d_\u2022 changes typicality are invalid (same topology). Next: analyze Baire status and category under genuinely coarser root\u2011insensitive topologies.",

    "content": "New observations and clarifications\n\n- Conjecture 1: Using the forgetful map \u03c0 (rooted\u2192unrooted), we have exact transfer of nowhere\u2011denseness and, for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), meagreness. Thus smallness/typicality for natural unrooted properties is root\u2011invariant. Caution: without the Baire property meagreness need not transfer.\n\n- Odd\u2011D regular: The \u03b4=1 parity gadget is confirmed. From any r\u2011ball F, add one layer W and choose internal edges so every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F\u2032)=1; any D\u2011regular completion has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\n\n- Even\u2011D regular: A finite refinement can concentrate all boundary deficit at the root (deg D\u22122) while saturating all other vertices to D. In any D\u2011regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1\u2011way bridges are parity\u2011forbidden; 2\u2011way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\n\n- Coarser topologies: Root\u2011insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any metric/topology still containing rooted cylinders as opens (or finite\u2011pinning) preserves the current typicality; no such topology can make bridgeless typical in \u2264D or in =D with odd D.\n\n- Metric caution: Adding an occurrence term to d_\u2022 (e.g., d_new = d_C\u2218\u03a6 + \u03b5 d_\u2022) does not change the topology; typicality and nowhere\u2011denseness remain unchanged under such metrics."

    "content": "Theorem (Even-D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).\nLet D\u22654 be even and consider X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology. Then the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre in X.\n\nProof. In a D-regular graph with even D, 1-way infinite bridges are impossible. Indeed, if e is a bridge and its deletion leaves a finite component H, then the size of the edge cut \\delta_G(V(H)) equals 1. On the other hand, for any finite induced subgraph H of a D-regular supergraph G,\n|\\delta_G(V(H))| = \\sum_{v\\in V(H)} (D-\\deg_H v) = D|V(H)| - 2|E(H)|,\nwhich is even when D is even, a contradiction. Thus any bridge in a D-regular graph with even D must be 2-way infinite. By Theorem 16 (from the extended abstract), the set B_2 of rooted graphs having a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre in X for all D>2. In the even-D regular space, \u201chas a bridge\u201d coincides with B_2, hence is meagre. Therefore its complement, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs, is comeagre. \u220e"
