So, if we claim \"has a bridge,\" it only refers to two-way bridges\u2014making it meagre and, therefore, bridgeless comeagre. Should I include this in proofs.md as a new proposition and proof?

Highlights and issues:\\n\\n- \u03c0\u2011framework: Multiple provers correctly prove \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere\u2011denseness transfers equivalently between unrooted (Y) and rooted (X), and meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic). Prover 3\u2019s clean Baire proof for Y via \u03c0 is correct. Please avoid claims beyond BP: Prover 5\u2019s \u201cmeagreness for all A\u2286Y\u201d is unsubstantiated; the step \u201cA non\u2011meagre \u21d2 \u2203 open V with A\u2229V comeagre\u201d fails without BP. Keep meagreness equivalence to BP sets.\\n\\n- Odd\u2011D gadgets: The \u03b4=1 parity construction is now rigorous. Ensure degree caps at the new layer W and that all interior vertices are saturated to D; both the counting choice (t and e_W) and the pinned\u2011seed variant (K_{D+2} with deletions) are valid.\\n\\n- Even\u2011D regular: The cut\u2011vertex forcing gadgets are now correct. Additionally, Prover 3\u2019s observation is important: in =D with even D, 1\u2011way bridges are impossible by parity; Theorem 16 makes 2\u2011way bridges meagre; thus \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre. This positive typicality statement should be recorded.\\n\\n- Theorem 16 formalization: Prover 1\u2019s edge\u2011replacement by 2\u2011terminal 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadgets is a sound way to forbid bridges within distance \u2264k while respecting degree bounds (use disjoint \u0398 gadgets; preserve degrees at endpoints). Good to keep as the canonical proof technique.\\n\\n- Coarser/nonlocal topologies: Density of 1\u2011way (and in some settings 2\u2011way) bridges under root\u2011insensitive/occurrence topologies is plausible and well\u2011argued; however, do not state compact/Polish/Baire without proofs. For \u03c4_any/occurrence, Baire holds on Y; for other proposals (tail, d_any), status is open\u2014mark clearly.\\n\\n- Caution on new metrics: Prover 2\u2019s d_new = d_C\u2218\u03a6 + \u03b5 d_\u2022 induces the same topology as d_\u2022 (\u03a6 is continuous w.r.t. d_\u2022); it cannot change nowhere\u2011denseness/typicality. The asserted density shift for bridgeless under d_new contradicts Theorem 14 and should be retracted. Prover 5\u2019s d_shift is a cylinder\u2011based metric; typicality remains unchanged; triangle inequality needs a precise proof if kept.\\n\\nNext steps:\\n- Finalize \u03c0\u2011based proofs (ND transfer; meagreness for BP sets) in proofs.md.\\n- Add the even\u2011D regular \u201cbridgeless is comeagre\u201d theorem (parity + Theorem 16) to proofs.md and output.md.\\n- Keep the odd\u2011D \u03b4=1 gadget and the even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex gadget, stated layer\u2011respectfully with degree checks, in proofs.md.\\n- For a chosen coarser topology (occurrence/tail), prove Baire (or provide counterexamples) and then decide category of bridgeful/bridgeless sets.\\n\",\"summary_md\":\"Conjecture 1 is settled for natural properties via the forgetful map \u03c0: nowhere\u2011denseness transfers exactly, and meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets.

In any D\u2011regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1\u2011way bridges are parity\u2011forbidden; 2\u2011way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\\n\\n- Coarser topologies: Root\u2011insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open.
