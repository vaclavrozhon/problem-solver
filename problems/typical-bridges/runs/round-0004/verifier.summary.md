Conjecture 1 is settled for natural properties via the forgetful map π: nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly, and meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets. For Conjecture 2, cylinder/finite‑lens metrics preserve typicality; odd‑D bridge‑forcing and even‑D cut‑vertex gadgets are rigorous. New result: in D‑regular with even D, bridgeless graphs are comeagre (1‑way bridges impossible; 2‑way bridges meagre). Claims that a metric mixing occurrences and d_• changes typicality are invalid (same topology). Next: analyze Baire status and category under genuinely coarser root‑insensitive topologies.
