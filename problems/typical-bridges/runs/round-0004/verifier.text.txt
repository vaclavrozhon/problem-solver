{"feedback_md":"Strong consolidation this round on Conjecture 1 (via the forgetful map π) and on robust “no‑go” regimes for Conjecture 2. Highlights and issues:\n\n- π‑framework: Multiple provers correctly prove π is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere‑denseness transfers equivalently between unrooted (Y) and rooted (X), and meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic). Prover 3’s clean Baire proof for Y via π is correct. Please avoid claims beyond BP: Prover 5’s “meagreness for all A⊆Y” is unsubstantiated; the step “A non‑meagre ⇒ ∃ open V with A∩V comeagre” fails without BP. Keep meagreness equivalence to BP sets.\n\n- Odd‑D gadgets: The δ=1 parity construction is now rigorous. Ensure degree caps at the new layer W and that all interior vertices are saturated to D; both the counting choice (t and e_W) and the pinned‑seed variant (K_{D+2} with deletions) are valid.\n\n- Even‑D regular: The cut‑vertex forcing gadgets are now correct. Additionally, Prover 3’s observation is important: in =D with even D, 1‑way bridges are impossible by parity; Theorem 16 makes 2‑way bridges meagre; thus “bridgeless” is comeagre. This positive typicality statement should be recorded.\n\n- Theorem 16 formalization: Prover 1’s edge‑replacement by 2‑terminal 2‑edge‑connected gadgets is a sound way to forbid bridges within distance ≤k while respecting degree bounds (use disjoint Θ gadgets; preserve degrees at endpoints). Good to keep as the canonical proof technique.\n\n- Coarser/nonlocal topologies: Density of 1‑way (and in some settings 2‑way) bridges under root‑insensitive/occurrence topologies is plausible and well‑argued; however, do not state compact/Polish/Baire without proofs. For τ_any/occurrence, Baire holds on Y; for other proposals (tail, d_any), status is open—mark clearly.\n\n- Caution on new metrics: Prover 2’s d_new = d_C∘Φ + ε d_• induces the same topology as d_• (Φ is continuous w.r.t. d_•); it cannot change nowhere‑denseness/typicality. The asserted density shift for bridgeless under d_new contradicts Theorem 14 and should be retracted. Prover 5’s d_shift is a cylinder‑based metric; typicality remains unchanged; triangle inequality needs a precise proof if kept.\n\nNext steps:\n- Finalize π‑based proofs (ND transfer; meagreness for BP sets) in proofs.md.\n- Add the even‑D regular “bridgeless is comeagre” theorem (parity + Theorem 16) to proofs.md and output.md.\n- Keep the odd‑D δ=1 gadget and the even‑D cut‑vertex gadget, stated layer‑respectfully with degree checks, in proofs.md.\n- For a chosen coarser topology (occurrence/tail), prove Baire (or provide counterexamples) and then decide category of bridgeful/bridgeless sets.\n","summary_md":"Conjecture 1 is settled for natural properties via the forgetful map π: nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly, and meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets.

Thus smallness/typicality for natural unrooted properties is root‑invariant. Caution: without the Baire property meagreness need not transfer.\n\n- Odd‑D regular: The δ=1 parity gadget is confirmed. From any r‑ball F, add one layer W and choose internal edges so every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1; any D‑regular completion has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge.\n\n- Even‑D regular: A finite refinement can concentrate all boundary deficit at the root (deg D−2) while saturating all other vertices to D. In any D‑regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\n\n- Coarser topologies: Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any metric/topology still containing rooted cylinders as opens (or finite‑pinning) preserves the current typicality; no such topology can make bridgeless typical in ≤D or in =D with odd D.\n\n- Metric caution: Adding an occurrence term to d_• (e.g., d_new = d_C∘Φ + ε d_•) does not change the topology; typicality and nowhere‑denseness remain unchanged under such metrics."},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Theorem (Even-D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).\nLet D≥4 be even and consider X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with the Benjamini–Schramm topology. Then the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre in X.\n\nProof. In a D-regular graph with even D, 1-way infinite bridges are impossible. Indeed, if e is a bridge and its deletion leaves a finite component H, then the size of the edge cut \\delta_G(V(H)) equals 1. On the other hand, for any finite induced subgraph H of a D-regular supergraph G,\n|\\delta_G(V(H))| = \\sum_{v\\in V(H)} (D-\\deg_H v) = D|V(H)| - 2|E(H)|,\nwhich is even when D is even, a contradiction. Thus any bridge in a D-regular graph with even D must be 2-way infinite. By Theorem 16 (from the extended abstract), the set B_2 of rooted graphs having a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre in X for all D>2. In the even-D regular space, “has a bridge” coincides with B_2, hence is meagre. Therefore its complement, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs, is comeagre. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"New classification in the even-regular case\n\n- In the D-regular space with even D≥4 (Benjamini–Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs are comeagre: 1-way bridges are parity-forbidden, while 2-way bridges form a meagre set.
