Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2

1) Root-invariance (Conjecture 1)
- Spaces: X = G_{\bullet,D} (rooted local topology), Y = unrooted countable connected graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v with B_r(G,v) ≅ F}.
- Forgetful map π: X → Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open, surjective.
- Consequences:
  • Nowhere denseness transfers: A⊆Y is nowhere dense ⇔ π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
  • Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic): A meagre in Y ⇔ π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
  • Hence for any natural property P of unrooted graphs (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.), the smallness/meagreness status of S_P in X is root-invariant.
- Alternative restatement (root-free ND test): For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense ⇔ for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}.
- Caution: Saturating a nowhere dense set need not remain nowhere dense (can become dense meagre). Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.

2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2
- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.
- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.

3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2
- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.
- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.

4) Section metrics on unrooted space
- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show ‘bridgeless’ remains nowhere dense for every section metric.

5) Action items
- Move π-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.
- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.
- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.
- For ‘2-way infinite bridge’ across section metrics, fill in the ‘not nowhere dense’ part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.


Addendum — Odd-D regular bridge gadget and coarser topologies

- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r′-ball F′ with S(F′)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.
- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.


Update — Root-invariance finalized; even-D cut-vertex forcing

- Conjecture 1: We adopt the forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted). π is continuous, open, surjective. For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. For sets A with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Thus smallness/meagreness of S_P is root-invariant for all natural properties considered. Note: without the Baire property, meagreness transfer need not hold; we avoid such claims.

- Odd D-regular (bridge forcing): We keep the δ(F′)=1 parity construction: extend an r-ball F by one layer W, choose t and e_W so that every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Then any D-regular completion has exactly one cross edge—a 1-way infinite bridge.

- Even D-regular (cut vertex forcing): We can refine any cylinder to pin a finite gadget so that all vertices except a designated vertex u have degree D within the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Consequently, in any D-regular completion all cross edges attach to u, making u a cut vertex. One explicit seed: start from K_{D,D}, pick x∈A, y1,y2∈B, delete x−y1 and x−y2, add y1−y2; pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Embedding this seed outward in the ball yields the desired refinement.

- Coarser topologies: For root-insensitive topologies (e.g., d_any/occurrence), graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; bridgeless graphs often are too (proved for D≥4 in Y). Baire/Polish status of these topologies remains the key open point to conclude typicality there.

New observations and clarifications

- Conjecture 1: Using the forgetful map π (rooted→unrooted), we have exact transfer of nowhere‑denseness and, for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), meagreness. Thus smallness/typicality for natural unrooted properties is root‑invariant. Caution: without the Baire property meagreness need not transfer.

- Odd‑D regular: The δ=1 parity gadget is confirmed. From any r‑ball F, add one layer W and choose internal edges so every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1; any D‑regular completion has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge.

- Even‑D regular: A finite refinement can concentrate all boundary deficit at the root (deg D−2) while saturating all other vertices to D. In any D‑regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

- Coarser topologies: Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any metric/topology still containing rooted cylinders as opens (or finite‑pinning) preserves the current typicality; no such topology can make bridgeless typical in ≤D or in =D with odd D.

- Metric caution: Adding an occurrence term to d_• (e.g., d_new = d_C∘Φ + ε d_•) does not change the topology; typicality and nowhere‑denseness remain unchanged under such metrics.
