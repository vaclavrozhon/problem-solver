# Rigorous Proofs



Set-up and notation
- X = G_{\bullet,D}: countable, connected, rooted graphs with degree constraint (either ≤D or =D), endowed with the Benjamini–Schramm topology (rooted cylinders as a base).
- Y: countable, connected, unrooted graphs with the same degree constraint, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y = { G: ∃v ∈ V(G) with B_r(G,v) ≅ F } for rooted r-balls F.
- For a rooted r-ball F, write U_F^X = { (G,ρ): B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F }.

Lemma 1 (Forgetful map is continuous and open).
Define π: X → Y by π(G,ρ)=G. Then:
(i) π is continuous: For any basic open U_F^Y, π^{-1}(U_F^Y) = U_F^X is open.
(ii) π is open: For any basic open U_F^X, π(U_F^X) = U_F^Y is open.
(iii) π is surjective.
Proof. (i) and (ii) follow directly from definitions. (iii) is trivial since every unrooted graph admits a root.

Theorem 2 (Nowhere-dense transfer between Y and X).
For any A ⊆ Y, A is nowhere dense in Y if and only if π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. (⇒) Let U⊆X be nonempty open. Then π(U) is open in Y by Lemma 1(ii). Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U′ := U ∩ π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and U′ ∩ π^{-1}(A) = ∅. Hence π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense.
(⇐) Let W⊆Y be nonempty open. Then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X by Lemma 1(i). Since π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open U′ ⊆ π^{-1}(W) with U′ ∩ π^{-1}(A) = ∅. Then π(U′) is nonempty open with π(U′) ⊆ W (by Lemma 1(ii)) and π(U′) ∩ A = ∅ (otherwise some x∈U′ maps into A). Hence A is nowhere dense.

Corollary 3 (Meagreness transfer for sets with the Baire property).
Let A ⊆ Y have the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not meagre. Since A has the Baire property, there exists nonempty open V⊆Y such that A∩V is comeagre in V. Then π^{-1}(A∩V) = π^{-1}(A) ∩ π^{-1}(V) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), which is a nonempty open subset of X by Lemma 1(i). Thus π^{-1}(A) is not meagre, a contradiction.

Proposition 4 (Root-free criterion for nowhere-denseness in X for saturated sets).
Let S ⊆ X be saturated (i.e., re-rooting within a fixed unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊆ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B) := ⋃_{v∈V(B)} U_{(B,v)}^X.
Proof. Let T := π(S) ⊆ Y. Since S is saturated, S = π^{-1}(T). By Theorem 2, S is nowhere dense in X iff T is nowhere dense in Y. Applying the standard cylinder refinement characterization of nowhere denseness in Y (identical to Lemma 13(3), but with unrooted cylinders U_{(B,v)}^Y aggregated over v), we obtain the stated root-free criterion.

Proposition 5 (Topological invariance across cylinder-based metrics).
Let τ be any topology on X for which the family of rooted cylinders {U_F^X} is a base. Then τ coincides with the Benjamini–Schramm topology, and for any S ⊆ X the properties “nowhere dense” and “meagre” are the same under τ and under the standard topology.
Proof. If {U_F^X} is a base, the topology it generates is the smallest topology containing all cylinders; this is precisely the standard topology. Hence τ equals the standard topology, and Baire-category notions coincide.

Proposition 6 (Bounded re-rooting yields homeomorphism of section metrics).
Let U_D be the set of unrooted graphs with degree constraint D, and s,t be two sections (root choices) with sup_G dist_G(s(G), t(G)) ≤ R_0 < ∞. Equip U_D with d_s(G,H) := d_•((G,s(G)), (H,s(H))) and d_t analogously. Then id: (U_D, d_s) → (U_D, d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, nowhere-dense/meagre sets are preserved.
Proof. If B_r(G,s(G)) ≅ B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r−R_0}(G,t(G)) ≅ B_{r−R_0}(H,t(H)) when r ≥ R_0. This gives continuity both ways.

Lemma 7 (Density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under re-rooting–insensitive local closeness).
Fix D ≥ 2. For any (G,ρ)∈X and r∈ℕ, there exists (H,σ) with Δ(H)≤D such that:
(i) B_r(H,σ) ≅ B_r(G,ρ);
(ii) H contains a 1-way infinite bridge.
Consequently, in any topology where basic neighborhoods of (G,ρ) include all graphs containing a rooted copy of B_r(G,ρ) somewhere (and symmetrically in the other direction), the set of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof. Let F := B_r(G,ρ). Since G is infinite, there exists a boundary vertex v∈V(F) (dist_F(v,ρ)=r) that has a neighbor in G\V(F). Hence deg_F(v) < deg_G(v) ≤ D. Build H by taking a copy of F and, outside F, adding a new vertex z adjacent only to v and attaching to z an infinite ray (z=w_0,w_1,w_2,…). For every other boundary vertex u of F, if desired, add new neighbors and finite trees outside F to keep Δ(H)≤D and ensure connectivity of H beyond F. Let σ be the copy of ρ in H. Then (i) holds by construction. The edge vz is a bridge in H and the component containing the ray is infinite, so (ii) holds.

Remarks.
- Proposition 4 and Theorem 2 together settle Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (root-invariant) and for meagreness for all Baire-property properties P of unrooted graphs (in particular, Borel P).
- Proposition 5 formalizes the no-go for “ball-local” or “cylinder-based” alternative metrics: typicality cannot change.
- Lemma 7 provides a concrete density phenomenon in a coarser, re-rooting–insensitive setting, motivating further analysis of Baire/totypicality there.


Proposition (Odd-D regular bridge-forcing cylinder via parity).
Let D≥3 be odd. Let F be a rooted r-ball that occurs in some D-regular graph. There exists r′≥r+1 and a rooted extension F′ such that:
(i) every vertex of F′ at distance < r′ from the root has degree D within F′;
(ii) S(F′):=∑_{x \in L_{r′}} (D - deg_{F′} x) = 1;
(iii) for every D-regular graph G extending F′, the unique edge of δ_G(V(B_{r′})) is a 1-way infinite bridge.

Proof.
Write L=L_r for the boundary of F and let δ(v)=D−deg_F(v)≥1 for v∈L. Let c=∑_{v∈L} δ(v)=S(F). Introduce a new layer W of t fresh vertices at distance r+1 from the root; connect each v∈L to δ(v) distinct vertices of W (possible since ∑ δ(v)=c). Now each v∈L attains degree D within the augmented graph. Vertices w∈W have current degrees s_w≥0 with ∑_{w∈W} s_w = c. Add an internal simple graph on W with e_W edges (disjoint from F∪L) to obtain F′ and set r′=r+1. Then
S(F′) = D t − (c + 2 e_W).
Choose t≥c with parity t ≡ c+1 (mod 2), and define e_W := (D t − c − 1)/2. Since D is odd, e_W is an integer; also 0 ≤ e_W ≤ ⌊(∑_{w∈W} (D − s_w))/2⌋ = ⌊(tD − c)/2⌋, so such a simple graph on W exists with degrees bounded by D−s_w. Thus (i) holds by construction (all vertices within distance ≤ r are saturated to D), and (ii) holds by the choice of t and e_W. For any D-regular completion G of F′, by the cut-size identity
|δ_G(V(B_{r′}))| = ∑_{x∈V(B_{r′})} (D - deg_{B_{r′}} x) = S(F′) = 1.
Hence exactly one edge leaves B_{r′}; since B_{r′} is finite and G is infinite, that edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, proving (iii). ∎

Corollary (Odd-D regular no-go under cylinder-based topologies).
In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, for any nonempty cylinder U=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F} there exists a refinement cylinder U′=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆U such that every member of U′ has a (1-way infinite) bridge. Therefore the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in any topology in which cylinders are open (in particular, under the Benjamini–Schramm topology).


Proposition (Even-D regular cut-vertex forcing cylinder).
Let D≥4 be even. In the space \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}, for any rooted r-ball F that occurs in a D-regular graph, there exists R≥r and a rooted refinement F^{\ast} with the following properties:
(i) every vertex at distance < R from the root in F^{\ast} has degree D within F^{\ast}, except the root ρ which has degree D−2;
(ii) F^{\ast} is realizable as a rooted R-ball in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D};
(iii) for any D-regular extension G of F^{\ast}, the vertex ρ is a cut vertex of G.

Proof.
Starting from F=B_r(G,ρ), we build a finite connected graph H extending F outward so that degrees inside are controlled and H is the rooted ball of some radius R. First, saturate all vertices at distances ≤ r to degree D by attaching new vertices at distance r+1 (respecting degree ≤ D). Choose R large enough so new attachments lie within distance < R, and repeat saturation layer by layer up to distance R−1, except at the root ρ where we target degree D−2. This yields a finite induced subgraph K with deg_K(v)=D for all v≠ρ and deg_K(ρ)=D−2, and all vertices of K are at distance < R from ρ (no edges are added within the boundary layer so the ball structure is preserved). Set F^{\ast} to be the rooted R-ball induced by K.

We must argue realizability (ii) while keeping degree caps. Consider K as a finite simple graph with max degree ≤ D, with target degrees t(v)=D for v≠ρ and t(ρ)=D−2. By a finite degree-completion lemma (Erdős–Gallai type), there exists a finite simple graph J ⊇ K, with K induced in J, such that deg_J(v)=t(v) for v∈V(K) and deg_J(u)≤ D for u∈V(J)\V(K). Concretely, add a large finite set W of new vertices and connect each v∈V(K) to exactly t(v)−deg_K(v) distinct vertices of W; then complete the remaining degrees within W by adding a simple D-bounded graph on W. Finally, attach to J any infinite D-regular completion outside the sphere S_R leaving the R-ball unchanged. Thus F^{\ast} occurs in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}.

For (iii), in any D-regular extension G of F^{\ast}, all vertices other than ρ are saturated to degree D inside B_R(G,ρ), so no cross edge can be incident to them. Since deg_{B_R}(ρ)=D−2, exactly two cross edges leave B_R and both are incident to ρ. Hence G−ρ disconnects: one component is the finite interior B_R\{ρ}, another is the (nonempty) exterior part, so ρ is a cut vertex. ∎

Theorem (Even-D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).
Let D≥4 be even and consider X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with the Benjamini–Schramm topology. Then the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre in X.

Proof. In a D-regular graph with even D, 1-way infinite bridges are impossible. Indeed, if e is a bridge and its deletion leaves a finite component H, then the size of the edge cut \delta_G(V(H)) equals 1. On the other hand, for any finite induced subgraph H of a D-regular supergraph G,
|\delta_G(V(H))| = \sum_{v\in V(H)} (D-\deg_H v) = D|V(H)| - 2|E(H)|,
which is even when D is even, a contradiction. Thus any bridge in a D-regular graph with even D must be 2-way infinite. By Theorem 16 (from the extended abstract), the set B_2 of rooted graphs having a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre in X for all D>2. In the even-D regular space, “has a bridge” coincides with B_2, hence is meagre. Therefore its complement, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs, is comeagre. ∎
