In infinite connected graphs, if a bridge deletion yields one finite and one infinite component, that\u2019s \"1-way infinite.\" However, we can't have two finite components, as that would imply a finite total, which contradicts being infinite and connected.

Let Y be the unrooted space equipped with the \u201crootless-local\u201d topology generated by U_F^Y={G: \u2203v with B_r(G,v)\u2245F}.\\n- \u03c0:X\u2192Y is surjective and open (\u03c0(G_\\\\bullet^F)=U_F^Y), but in general not continuous: \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in X. Indeed, fix D\u22653, a rooted r-ball F containing a cycle. Let (G,\u03c1) be any rooted graph whose underlying graph contains exactly one occurrence of F, sitting beyond distance N from \u03c1. For any s<N, every (H,\u03c1) with B_s(H,\u03c1)=B_s(G,\u03c1) can be obtained by modifying G outside B_s(G,\u03c1). Modifying G beyond radius s to destroy the unique F (replace the far region by a tree) yields (H,\u03c1)\u2209\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y), yet arbitrarily close to (G,\u03c1). Thus \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open; hence \u03c0 is not continuous. \\n- Takeaway: arguments for Conjecture 1 should avoid continuity of \u03c0. The nowhere-dense part can be handled within X via saturated-cylinder refinements (root-free formulation below). For meagreness, restrict to Baire\u2011property sets and use game/topological arguments internal to X.\\n\\n2) Root\u2011free criterion for nowhere denseness (safe resolution of Conjecture 1, ND part)\\n\\nLet S\u2282X be saturated (i.e., depends only on the unrooted graph). For an unrooted r-ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B)=\u22c3_{v\u2208V(B)} G_\\\\bullet^{(B,v)}.\\nProposition 2.1. S is nowhere dense in X iff for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r\u2032-ball B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\\\S.\\nProof. This is a root\u2011free restatement of the standard cylinder\u2011refinement criterion: cylinders form a base, and saturated unions across all rootings of B are finite unions of cylinders. The usual \u201cnowhere dense iff each nonempty basic open contains a smaller basic open disjoint from S\u201d translates verbatim to the unrooted formulation via Cyl(B).\\n\\n3) Even\u2011D regular case: bridgeless is comeagre (a complete, concise proof)\\n\\nTheorem 3.1. In X=G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D\u22654, the set Br of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.\\nProof. In an infinite connected graph, every bridge is either 1\u2011way infinite or 2\u2011way infinite. In D\u2011regular graphs with even D, 1\u2011way infinite bridges are parity\u2011forbidden (each finite cut has even size), hence cannot occur. By Theorem 16, the set T_{2wb} of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in X. Therefore X\\\\Br = T_{2wb} is meagre, so Br is comeagre in the Baire space X.\\n\\n4) Canonical, degree\u2011respecting gadgets (now fully explicit)\\n\\n4.1 Odd D (D\u22653): unique external edge forcing\\nFor a finite connected F, S(F)=\u2211_{v}(D\u2212deg_F(v)). In any D\u2011regular completion H\u2287F, |\u03b4_H(V(F))|=S(F). For odd D and any rooted r\u2011ball F that occurs in some D\u2011regular graph, we produce an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with S(F\u2032)=1:\\n- Let L be the boundary of F, c=\u2211_{v\u2208L}(D\u2212deg_F(v)). Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1; connect each v\u2208L to D\u2212deg_F(v) distinct vertices in W (total c edges). Add e_W internal edges in W so that e_W=(D t\u2212c\u22121)/2; choose t\u2265c with t\u2261c+1 (mod 2) so e_W\u2208\\\\mathbb{N} and degrees in W \u2264 D. Then S(F\u2032)=Dt\u2212(c+2e_W)=1. \\n- All vertices within distance \u2264r are saturated to degree D in F\u2032, so F\u2032 is an (r+1)-ball. In any D\u2011regular completion, exactly one edge leaves V(F\u2032), necessarily a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge.\\n\\n4.2 Even D (D\u22654): cut\u2011vertex forcing\\nWe build a finite D\u2011bounded refinement with a designated u of degree D\u22122; all other vertices in the r\u2032\u2011ball have degree D.\\n- Inside K_{D+2}, delete a fixed perfect matching to obtain a D\u2011regular connected R. Pick x and y,z so that yz belongs to the deleted matching. Remove xy and xz, add yz; denote u:=x. Then deg_R(u)=D\u22122; all other vertices have degree D, and R\u2212u is connected. Graft R far beyond the original boundary and saturate all vertices within radius to form an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032. \\n- In any D\u2011regular completion, exactly two external edges must be added (S(F\u2032)=2), both incident to u. Removing u disconnects the graph; hence u is a cut vertex.\\n\\n5) Local exclusion for 2\u2011way bridges near the root (formalizing Theorem 16\u2019s \u201cnowhere dense\u201d step)\\n\\nFix k\u2208\\\\mathbb{N}. Let A_k be the set of rooted graphs in X with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root. We show A_k is nowhere dense via 2\u2011terminal replacements.\\nLemma 5.1. For any cylinder G_\\\\bullet^F and k, there is a refinement cylinder G_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2282G_\\\\bullet^F such that no extension of F\u2032 contains a bridge at distance \u2264k.\\nProof. Let E_k be edges of F with both endpoints at distance \u2264k from the root. For each e=uv\u2208E_k, replace e within F by a 2\u2011terminal, 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadget \u0398_e: delete uv; insert a gadget with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e\u2013t_e paths (e.g., a \u03b8\u2011graph of lengths 2 and 3); connect u\u2013s_e and v\u2013t_e by single edges. This preserves deg(u),deg(v); all internal degrees are \u22643\u2264D (since D>2). Do this disjointly for all e\u2208E_k, placing gadgets within an expanded radius r\u2032. In any extension, all edges within distance \u2264k are contained in cycles (inside \u0398_e), and hence are not bridges. Therefore the refined cylinder avoids A_k. Thus A_k is nowhere dense, and \u22c3_k A_k (graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge) is meagre.\\n\\n6) Strengthened no\u2011go: finite\u2011lens (FLP) topologies cannot change typicality\\n\\nDefinition 6.1 (FLP opens). An FLP open set is specified by finitely many designated vertices v_1,\u2026,v_m and radii r_1,\u2026,r_m together with isomorphism types of the rooted balls around them, without imposing constraints elsewhere.\\nObservation 6.2. Every FLP open set is a finite union of intersections of standard cylinders, hence the FLP topology equals the BS topology. Consequently, Theorems 14\u201317, the even\u2011D comeagreness of bridgeless graphs, and all \u201ccylinder\u2011refinement\u201d arguments persist under any FLP metric.\\n\\n7) Root\u2011insensitive pseudometric d_any: density upgrades\\n\\nDefine on X: for x=(G,\u03c1), y=(H,\u03c3), let \u03b4(x,y)=2^{\u2212sup{ r: \u2203\u03c3\u2032 B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3\u2032) }} and d_any(x,y)=max{\u03b4(x,y),\u03b4(y,x)}. Two graphs are close if each one\u2019s rooted balls appear somewhere in the other.\\n- 1\u2011way bridges dense (\u2264D): given (G,\u03c1) and r, take F=B_r(G,\u03c1), attach beyond radius r a pendant infinite ray by a single edge at a boundary vertex with available degree, and complete the remainder at distance \u2265 r+1. Then d_any\u22642^{\u2212r}.\\n- 2\u2011way bridges dense (\u2264D): attach beyond radius r two disjoint infinite bounded\u2011degree structures S_1,S_2 and then a single edge e between them; ensure connectivity to the copy of F occurs outside radius r; e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge.\\n- Bridgeless dense (\u2264D): graft the copy of F to a 2\u2011edge\u2011connected infinite scaffold S (e.g., an infinite ladder for D\u22653; for general D use a 2\u2011edge\u2011connected bounded\u2011degree graph) by connecting boundary vertices into S along edge\u2011disjoint paths so that each crossing edge lies on a cycle. Then H is bridgeless and d_any\u22642^{\u2212r}.\\nRemark. Under d_any, all three classes (bridgeless, 1\u2011way, and 2\u2011way bridgeful) are dense. Typicality thus hinges on whether the d_any\u2011quotient is Baire; we leave this open.\\n\\n8) Ideas, obstacles, and next steps\\n\\n- Ideas: Use the root\u2011free cylinder criterion (2.1) as the canonical tool for Conjecture 1 (ND part). For meagreness, employ the Banach\u2013Mazur game on cylinders: S is meagre iff Player II can avoid S. Design root\u2011free strategies for saturated S (bridges, cut vertices, \u03c7\u2032=D+1) to obtain explicit, root\u2011invariant proofs.\\n- Examples: The \u0398\u2011replacement in Lemma 5.1 prevents bridges within bounded distance uniformly in both \u2264D and =D settings; the odd\u2011D gadget C1 and even\u2011D gadget D1 are fully explicit and degree\u2011respecting.\\n- Obstacles: The earlier \u201c\u03c0 is continuous and open\u201d claim for the rootless topology is false; hence meagreness transfer must avoid that route. For d_any, we lack a proof of Baire\u2011ness (or even of metric completeness on the quotient); typicality statements there remain conditional.\\n- Next steps: (i) Add full proofs of Lemmas/Propositions 2.1, 5.1 and Theorem 3.1 to proofs.md. (ii) Formalize the Banach\u2013Mazur game for saturated sets; verify meagreness of T_{2wb} via a root\u2011free II\u2011strategy. (iii) For Conjecture 2, choose a specific root\u2011insensitive topology (e.g., occurrence pattern on Y) and determine its Baire status; then classify bridges\u2019 category there. (iv) Record FLP no\u2011go (6.2) in proofs.md to delimit \u201cnatural alternative metrics\u201d that cannot alter typicality.\\n\"}",
