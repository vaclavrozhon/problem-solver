New contributions, corrections, and rigor upgrades

1) Correction: the forgetful map π is not continuous for the “rootless-local” topology on unrooted graphs

Let X=G_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) topology (cylinder base G_\bullet^F). Let Y be the unrooted space equipped with the “rootless-local” topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v with B_r(G,v)≅F}.
- π:X→Y is surjective and open (π(G_\bullet^F)=U_F^Y), but in general not continuous: π^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in X. Indeed, fix D≥3, a rooted r-ball F containing a cycle. Let (G,ρ) be any rooted graph whose underlying graph contains exactly one occurrence of F, sitting beyond distance N from ρ. For any s<N, every (H,ρ) with B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) can be obtained by modifying G outside B_s(G,ρ). Modifying G beyond radius s to destroy the unique F (replace the far region by a tree) yields (H,ρ)∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y), yet arbitrarily close to (G,ρ). Thus π^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open; hence π is not continuous. 
- Takeaway: arguments for Conjecture 1 should avoid continuity of π. The nowhere-dense part can be handled within X via saturated-cylinder refinements (root-free formulation below). For meagreness, restrict to Baire‑property sets and use game/topological arguments internal to X.

2) Root‑free criterion for nowhere denseness (safe resolution of Conjecture 1, ND part)

Let S⊂X be saturated (i.e., depends only on the unrooted graph). For an unrooted r-ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_\bullet^{(B,v)}.
Proposition 2.1. S is nowhere dense in X iff for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S.
Proof. This is a root‑free restatement of the standard cylinder‑refinement criterion: cylinders form a base, and saturated unions across all rootings of B are finite unions of cylinders. The usual “nowhere dense iff each nonempty basic open contains a smaller basic open disjoint from S” translates verbatim to the unrooted formulation via Cyl(B).

3) Even‑D regular case: bridgeless is comeagre (a complete, concise proof)

Theorem 3.1. In X=G_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4, the set Br of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
Proof. In an infinite connected graph, every bridge is either 1‑way infinite or 2‑way infinite. In D‑regular graphs with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges are parity‑forbidden (each finite cut has even size), hence cannot occur. By Theorem 16, the set T_{2wb} of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in X. Therefore X\Br = T_{2wb} is meagre, so Br is comeagre in the Baire space X.

4) Canonical, degree‑respecting gadgets (now fully explicit)

4.1 Odd D (D≥3): unique external edge forcing
For a finite connected F, S(F)=∑_{v}(D−deg_F(v)). In any D‑regular completion H⊇F, |δ_H(V(F))|=S(F). For odd D and any rooted r‑ball F that occurs in some D‑regular graph, we produce an r′‑ball F′ with S(F′)=1:
- Let L be the boundary of F, c=∑_{v∈L}(D−deg_F(v)). Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1; connect each v∈L to D−deg_F(v) distinct vertices in W (total c edges). Add e_W internal edges in W so that e_W=(D t−c−1)/2; choose t≥c with t≡c+1 (mod 2) so e_W∈\mathbb{N} and degrees in W ≤ D. Then S(F′)=Dt−(c+2e_W)=1. 
- All vertices within distance ≤r are saturated to degree D in F′, so F′ is an (r+1)-ball. In any D‑regular completion, exactly one edge leaves V(F′), necessarily a (1‑way infinite) bridge.

4.2 Even D (D≥4): cut‑vertex forcing
We build a finite D‑bounded refinement with a designated u of degree D−2; all other vertices in the r′‑ball have degree D.
- Inside K_{D+2}, delete a fixed perfect matching to obtain a D‑regular connected R. Pick x and y,z so that yz belongs to the deleted matching. Remove xy and xz, add yz; denote u:=x. Then deg_R(u)=D−2; all other vertices have degree D, and R−u is connected. Graft R far beyond the original boundary and saturate all vertices within radius to form an r′‑ball F′. 
- In any D‑regular completion, exactly two external edges must be added (S(F′)=2), both incident to u. Removing u disconnects the graph; hence u is a cut vertex.

5) Local exclusion for 2‑way bridges near the root (formalizing Theorem 16’s “nowhere dense” step)

Fix k∈\mathbb{N}. Let A_k be the set of rooted graphs in X with a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root. We show A_k is nowhere dense via 2‑terminal replacements.
Lemma 5.1. For any cylinder G_\bullet^F and k, there is a refinement cylinder G_\bullet^{F′}⊂G_\bullet^F such that no extension of F′ contains a bridge at distance ≤k.
Proof. Let E_k be edges of F with both endpoints at distance ≤k from the root. For each e=uv∈E_k, replace e within F by a 2‑terminal, 2‑edge‑connected gadget Θ_e: delete uv; insert a gadget with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e–t_e paths (e.g., a θ‑graph of lengths 2 and 3); connect u–s_e and v–t_e by single edges. This preserves deg(u),deg(v); all internal degrees are ≤3≤D (since D>2). Do this disjointly for all e∈E_k, placing gadgets within an expanded radius r′. In any extension, all edges within distance ≤k are contained in cycles (inside Θ_e), and hence are not bridges. Therefore the refined cylinder avoids A_k. Thus A_k is nowhere dense, and ⋃_k A_k (graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge) is meagre.

6) Strengthened no‑go: finite‑lens (FLP) topologies cannot change typicality

Definition 6.1 (FLP opens). An FLP open set is specified by finitely many designated vertices v_1,…,v_m and radii r_1,…,r_m together with isomorphism types of the rooted balls around them, without imposing constraints elsewhere.
Observation 6.2. Every FLP open set is a finite union of intersections of standard cylinders, hence the FLP topology equals the BS topology. Consequently, Theorems 14–17, the even‑D comeagreness of bridgeless graphs, and all “cylinder‑refinement” arguments persist under any FLP metric.

7) Root‑insensitive pseudometric d_any: density upgrades

Define on X: for x=(G,ρ), y=(H,σ), let δ(x,y)=2^{−sup{ r: ∃σ′ B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ′) }} and d_any(x,y)=max{δ(x,y),δ(y,x)}. Two graphs are close if each one’s rooted balls appear somewhere in the other.
- 1‑way bridges dense (≤D): given (G,ρ) and r, take F=B_r(G,ρ), attach beyond radius r a pendant infinite ray by a single edge at a boundary vertex with available degree, and complete the remainder at distance ≥ r+1. Then d_any≤2^{−r}.
- 2‑way bridges dense (≤D): attach beyond radius r two disjoint infinite bounded‑degree structures S_1,S_2 and then a single edge e between them; ensure connectivity to the copy of F occurs outside radius r; e is a 2‑way infinite bridge.
- Bridgeless dense (≤D): graft the copy of F to a 2‑edge‑connected infinite scaffold S (e.g., an infinite ladder for D≥3; for general D use a 2‑edge‑connected bounded‑degree graph) by connecting boundary vertices into S along edge‑disjoint paths so that each crossing edge lies on a cycle. Then H is bridgeless and d_any≤2^{−r}.
Remark. Under d_any, all three classes (bridgeless, 1‑way, and 2‑way bridgeful) are dense. Typicality thus hinges on whether the d_any‑quotient is Baire; we leave this open.

8) Ideas, obstacles, and next steps

- Ideas: Use the root‑free cylinder criterion (2.1) as the canonical tool for Conjecture 1 (ND part). For meagreness, employ the Banach–Mazur game on cylinders: S is meagre iff Player II can avoid S. Design root‑free strategies for saturated S (bridges, cut vertices, χ′=D+1) to obtain explicit, root‑invariant proofs.
- Examples: The Θ‑replacement in Lemma 5.1 prevents bridges within bounded distance uniformly in both ≤D and =D settings; the odd‑D gadget C1 and even‑D gadget D1 are fully explicit and degree‑respecting.
- Obstacles: The earlier “π is continuous and open” claim for the rootless topology is false; hence meagreness transfer must avoid that route. For d_any, we lack a proof of Baire‑ness (or even of metric completeness on the quotient); typicality statements there remain conditional.
- Next steps: (i) Add full proofs of Lemmas/Propositions 2.1, 5.1 and Theorem 3.1 to proofs.md. (ii) Formalize the Banach–Mazur game for saturated sets; verify meagreness of T_{2wb} via a root‑free II‑strategy. (iii) For Conjecture 2, choose a specific root‑insensitive topology (e.g., occurrence pattern on Y) and determine its Baire status; then classify bridges’ category there. (iv) Record FLP no‑go (6.2) in proofs.md to delimit “natural alternative metrics” that cannot alter typicality.
