  "content": "Corrections\n\n- The earlier metric d_new(x,y)=d_C(Occ\u2218\u03c0(x),Occ\u2218\u03c0(y))+\u03b5 d_\u2022(x,y) is topologically equivalent to d_\u2022 because Occ\u2218\u03c0 is continuous in d_\u2022. Hence typicality/nowhere\u2011denseness do not change under d_new. Any claim to the contrary is retracted.\n\nRoot\u2013unrooted transfer and Baire property\n\n- Lemma 1 (\u03c0 continuous, open, surjective). For the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0^{-1}(U_Y(F))=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F and \u03c0(\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F)=U_Y(F), so \u03c0 is continuous and open; surjectivity is trivial.\n- Lemma 2 (Baire). X is compact metric (diagonal extraction on rooted balls). Y is Baire as a continuous open image of the Baire space X.\n- Proposition 3 (Nowhere\u2011dense transfer). For A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. Proof: openness/continuity of \u03c0 transfer interior of closures in both directions.\n- Proposition 4 (Meagreness for BP sets). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) meagre in X. Proof: pullback/\u201copen symmetric difference\u201d argument; X is Baire.\n\nEven\u2011D regular: bridgeless is comeagre\n\n- Theorem 5. In \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,=D} for even D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.\n  Proof. A 1\u2011way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component S with |\u03b4(S)|=1. In a D\u2011regular graph, D|S|=2|E(S)|+|\u03b4(S)|; the left side is even and 2|E(S)| is even, so |\u03b4(S)| is even. Hence 1\u2011way bridges are impossible. Therefore \u201chas a bridge\u201d = \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d. By Theorem 16, the latter is meagre; its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\n\nOdd\u2011D regular: bridge forcing gadget (cleaned)\n\n- Notation. For a finite connected rooted subgraph H (intended to be the refined ball), define S(H)=\u2211_{v\u2208V(H)}(D\u2212deg_H(v)). In any D\u2011regular extension, |\u03b4(V(H))|=S(H). For odd D, S(H)\u2261|V(H)| (mod 2).\n- Gadgets.\n  \u2022 Port creation: For a boundary vertex x, attach D\u2212deg_H(x) disjoint paths x\u2013a\u2013b and saturate a,b to degree D using only new vertices outward. S(H) unchanged; deficit moves to ports b at larger radius.\n  \u2022 Pair closure: Given two ports b_i,b_j, embed them as the two degree\u2011(D\u22121) vertices of a copy of K_{D+1}\u2212e placed outward; add the missing edge inside the gadget. This reduces S by 2 and saturates all new vertices to degree D.\n  \u2022 Parity flipper (odd D): Add a vertex z adjacent to two boundary vertices and saturate z outward to degree D; \u0394S=D\u22124 is odd.\n- Lemma 6 (Reduction to S=1 while preserving ball structure). From any rooted r\u2011ball F in an odd\u2011D regular graph, by outward\u2011only applications of the above gadgets one obtains a finite connected H\u2287F with S(H)=1 such that no new edges join interior vertices and all interior vertices (distance \u2264 current boundary) have degree D. Thus H is the rooted r\u2032\u2011ball (for some r\u2032>r) in any D\u2011regular extension.\n  Sketch. If S(F) even, flip parity once. Port\u2011create at all boundary vertices until they are saturated; while S>1, pair\u2011close two ports at a time. All new edges are incident to outward vertices only; degrees of interior vertices are D, so no further edges to the outside appear in any extension. Hence H is a ball; and |\u03b4(V(H))|=1 in any extension.\n- Proposition 7 (Odd\u2011D bridge forcing). For odd D>2, every cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^F has a refinement \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} such that every D\u2011regular extension of F\u2032 contains a bridge. Proof: Take H from Lemma 6; the unique cross edge is a bridge.\n\nBounded re\u2011rooting invariance for section metrics\n\n- Lemma 8. If sections s,t on Y satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264N for all G, then Id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. Proof: If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))\u2245B_{r+N}(H,s(H)); moving roots by \u2264N yields B_r(G,t(G))\u2245B_r(H,t(H)). Symmetric argument gives the inverse.\n\nDensity phenomena in the unrooted occurrence (rootless local) topology\n\n- Lemma 9 (Density of 1\u2011way bridges in Y). Given finitely many required rooted occurrences and forbiddances within radius R, there exists G with \u0394\u2264D containing the required patterns, avoiding the forbidden ones, and having a 1\u2011way infinite bridge (attach a pendant infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected block by a single edge to a finite core realizing the constraints, using high girth to avoid forbidden patterns).\n- Lemma 10 (Density of bridgeless graphs in Y). Under the same finite constraints, there exists an infinite bridgeless G with \u0394\u2264D realizing them (attach a high\u2011girth infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected backbone and connect the core by two edge\u2011disjoint paths).\n- Comment. By \u03c0\u2011transfer, these density statements lift to the rooted space X. They do not contradict Theorem 14: a set can be dense and nowhere dense simultaneously.\n\nNo\u2011go for cylinder\u2011based metric changes\n\n- Proposition 11. Any metric on X whose open sets are unions of rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_\u2022; hence nowhere\u2011denseness and meagreness (Baire\u2011property sets) are unchanged. In particular, mixing any continuous \u201coccurrence\u201d term with d_\u2022 (as in the retracted d_new) preserves typicality.\n\nExamples\n\n- Parity check (odd D): For D=3 and a tree H on m vertices, S(H)=3m\u22122(m\u22121)=m+2 (odd \u21d4 m odd), validating the need for a parity flip when necessary.\n- Even D comeagre: In 4\u2011regular graphs, 1\u2011way bridges are parity\u2011forbidden; \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre; thus bridgeless is typical.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing (sketch provided previously) still requires a full layer\u2011respecting degree bookkeeping write\u2011up.\n- The ball\u2011preservation detail in Lemma 6 (H is indeed a rooted ball in all extensions) needs a short formal argument using \u201cinterior vertices saturated to degree D\u201d and outward\u2011only attachments.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move Lemmas 1\u20132, Propositions 3\u20134 to proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 rigorously.\n- Write a complete proof of Lemma 6 and Proposition 7 with explicit radii and disjointness of gadgets; add the even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing lemma fully.\n- Record Theorem 5 (even D regular: bridgeless comeagre) in output.md and proofs.md.\n- For Conjecture 2, focus on genuinely non\u2011cylinder topologies (e.g., tail/complement topologies). Establish Baire/non\u2011Baire status and then determine the category of bridgeful/bridgeless sets there. Avoid cylinder\u2011based mixes like the retracted d_new."
