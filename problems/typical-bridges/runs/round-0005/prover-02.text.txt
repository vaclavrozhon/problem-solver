Corrections

- The earlier metric d_new(x,y)=d_C(Occ∘π(x),Occ∘π(y))+ε d_•(x,y) is topologically equivalent to d_• because Occ∘π is continuous in d_•. Hence typicality/nowhere‑denseness do not change under d_new. Any claim to the contrary is retracted.

Root–unrooted transfer and Baire property

- Lemma 1 (π continuous, open, surjective). For the forgetful map π:X→Y, π^{-1}(U_Y(F))=𝔾_{•}^F and π(𝔾_{•}^F)=U_Y(F), so π is continuous and open; surjectivity is trivial.
- Lemma 2 (Baire). X is compact metric (diagonal extraction on rooted balls). Y is Baire as a continuous open image of the Baire space X.
- Proposition 3 (Nowhere‑dense transfer). For A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. Proof: openness/continuity of π transfer interior of closures in both directions.
- Proposition 4 (Meagreness for BP sets). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) meagre in X. Proof: pullback/“open symmetric difference” argument; X is Baire.

Even‑D regular: bridgeless is comeagre

- Theorem 5. In 𝔾_{•,=D} for even D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
  Proof. A 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component S with |δ(S)|=1. In a D‑regular graph, D|S|=2|E(S)|+|δ(S)|; the left side is even and 2|E(S)| is even, so |δ(S)| is even. Hence 1‑way bridges are impossible. Therefore “has a bridge” = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge”. By Theorem 16, the latter is meagre; its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Odd‑D regular: bridge forcing gadget (cleaned)

- Notation. For a finite connected rooted subgraph H (intended to be the refined ball), define S(H)=∑_{v∈V(H)}(D−deg_H(v)). In any D‑regular extension, |δ(V(H))|=S(H). For odd D, S(H)≡|V(H)| (mod 2).
- Gadgets.
  • Port creation: For a boundary vertex x, attach D−deg_H(x) disjoint paths x–a–b and saturate a,b to degree D using only new vertices outward. S(H) unchanged; deficit moves to ports b at larger radius.
  • Pair closure: Given two ports b_i,b_j, embed them as the two degree‑(D−1) vertices of a copy of K_{D+1}−e placed outward; add the missing edge inside the gadget. This reduces S by 2 and saturates all new vertices to degree D.
  • Parity flipper (odd D): Add a vertex z adjacent to two boundary vertices and saturate z outward to degree D; ΔS=D−4 is odd.
- Lemma 6 (Reduction to S=1 while preserving ball structure). From any rooted r‑ball F in an odd‑D regular graph, by outward‑only applications of the above gadgets one obtains a finite connected H⊇F with S(H)=1 such that no new edges join interior vertices and all interior vertices (distance ≤ current boundary) have degree D. Thus H is the rooted r′‑ball (for some r′>r) in any D‑regular extension.
  Sketch. If S(F) even, flip parity once. Port‑create at all boundary vertices until they are saturated; while S>1, pair‑close two ports at a time. All new edges are incident to outward vertices only; degrees of interior vertices are D, so no further edges to the outside appear in any extension. Hence H is a ball; and |δ(V(H))|=1 in any extension.
- Proposition 7 (Odd‑D bridge forcing). For odd D>2, every cylinder 𝔾_{•}^F has a refinement 𝔾_{•}^{F′} such that every D‑regular extension of F′ contains a bridge. Proof: Take H from Lemma 6; the unique cross edge is a bridge.

Bounded re‑rooting invariance for section metrics

- Lemma 8. If sections s,t on Y satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤N for all G, then Id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. Proof: If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))≅B_{r+N}(H,s(H)); moving roots by ≤N yields B_r(G,t(G))≅B_r(H,t(H)). Symmetric argument gives the inverse.

Density phenomena in the unrooted occurrence (rootless local) topology

- Lemma 9 (Density of 1‑way bridges in Y). Given finitely many required rooted occurrences and forbiddances within radius R, there exists G with Δ≤D containing the required patterns, avoiding the forbidden ones, and having a 1‑way infinite bridge (attach a pendant infinite 2‑edge‑connected block by a single edge to a finite core realizing the constraints, using high girth to avoid forbidden patterns).
- Lemma 10 (Density of bridgeless graphs in Y). Under the same finite constraints, there exists an infinite bridgeless G with Δ≤D realizing them (attach a high‑girth infinite 2‑edge‑connected backbone and connect the core by two edge‑disjoint paths).
- Comment. By π‑transfer, these density statements lift to the rooted space X. They do not contradict Theorem 14: a set can be dense and nowhere dense simultaneously.

No‑go for cylinder‑based metric changes

- Proposition 11. Any metric on X whose open sets are unions of rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_•; hence nowhere‑denseness and meagreness (Baire‑property sets) are unchanged. In particular, mixing any continuous “occurrence” term with d_• (as in the retracted d_new) preserves typicality.

Examples

- Parity check (odd D): For D=3 and a tree H on m vertices, S(H)=3m−2(m−1)=m+2 (odd ⇔ m odd), validating the need for a parity flip when necessary.
- Even D comeagre: In 4‑regular graphs, 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre; thus bridgeless is typical.

Obstacles

- Even‑D cut‑vertex forcing (sketch provided previously) still requires a full layer‑respecting degree bookkeeping write‑up.
- The ball‑preservation detail in Lemma 6 (H is indeed a rooted ball in all extensions) needs a short formal argument using “interior vertices saturated to degree D” and outward‑only attachments.

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Propositions 3–4 to proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 rigorously.
- Write a complete proof of Lemma 6 and Proposition 7 with explicit radii and disjointness of gadgets; add the even‑D cut‑vertex forcing lemma fully.
- Record Theorem 5 (even D regular: bridgeless comeagre) in output.md and proofs.md.
- For Conjecture 2, focus on genuinely non‑cylinder topologies (e.g., tail/complement topologies). Establish Baire/non‑Baire status and then determine the category of bridgeful/bridgeless sets there. Avoid cylinder‑based mixes like the retracted d_new.
