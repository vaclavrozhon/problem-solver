This lets us pull typicality statements between X and Y for saturated properties.\n- Close the gap \u201cD=3 bridgeless dense in Y\u201d: give a constructive, degree\u2011bounded, 2\u2011edge\u2011connected completion procedure that, starting from any valid finite r\u2011ball F, builds an infinite bridgeless graph of maximum degree \u2264 D (D\u22653) containing an occurrence of F. This removes a previous open point and strengthens the coarser\u2011topology analysis.\n- Record a simple parity+Theorem\u00a016 proof that in =D with even D, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under d_\u2022 (and in Y), complementing the odd\u2011D no\u2011go.\n- Extract a general no\u2011go principle: on any Baire topology on X in which rooted cylinders are open, bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre in \u2264D (and in =D for odd D) because \u201chas a (1\u2011way) bridge\u201d contains a nonempty open cylinder.\n\nBaire property of the unrooted space\nLemma 1. Let X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} with the rooted local topology and Y the unrooted degree\u2011bounded space with the rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. Then Y is a Baire space.\nProof. The forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G, is continuous, open and surjective (preimage/image of a cylinder is a cylinder). Let (U_n)_n be dense open in Y. Then \u03c0^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X, hence \u22c2_n \u03c0^{-1}(U_n) is dense in X. For any nonempty open W\u2286Y, \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X and intersects \u22c2_n \u03c0^{-1}(U_n). Applying \u03c0 (which is open), we get W\u2229\u22c2_n U_n\u2260\u2205. \u220e\n\nEven\u2011regular typicality\nLemma 2 (Cut\u2011size parity for finite subgraphs). If H is a finite induced subgraph of a D\u2011regular graph G, then |\u03b4_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|\u22122|E(H)| is even.\nProof. Sum degrees in G over V(H): D|V(H)|=2|E(H)|+|\u03b4_G(V(H))|. \u220e\nTheorem 3. In X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with even D\u22654 (and likewise in Y), the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre under the standard topology.\nProof. Theorem\u00a016 gives that graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge form a meagre set in X; by Corollary\u00a03 (meagreness transfer for Baire\u2011property sets via \u03c0), the same holds in Y. In even\u2011regular graphs, 1\u2011way infinite bridges are parity\u2011forbidden by Lemma\u00a02 (applied to the finite component). Hence \u201chas a bridge\u201d is meagre, and its complement \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre. \u220e\n\nDegree\u2011completion tool\nLemma 4 (Degree completion to an infinite D\u2011bounded supergraph). Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree \u2264 D and D\u22653. Then there exists a connected infinite supergraph G\u2287H with max degree \u2264 D such that no new edges are added between vertices of H.\nProof (sketch). Build an infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected \u201cbackbone\u201d R of maximum degree \u22643 (e.g., the infinite ladder; to keep degrees \u22643 upon attachments, first subdivide every edge of the ladder once, producing many degree\u20112 vertices). Enumerate the boundary \u201cstubs\u201d of H: the multiset S={ (v,i): 1\u2264i\u2264D\u2212deg_H(v) }. For each s\u2208S, attach a new path of length \u22651 from v to a distinct degree\u20112 vertex of the subdivided ladder, using fresh vertices; this raises v\u2019s degree by 1 and that ladder vertex\u2019s degree to 3, keeping degrees \u2264D. Do this so the attachments are disjoint outside H; the result is connected and infinite, with max degree \u2264D, and no new H\u2013H edges. \u220e\n\nBridgeless density in Y for D\u22653\nProposition 5. Fix D\u22653. In the unrooted space Y with max degree \u2264D, the set of bridgeless graphs is dense.\nProof. Let U_F^Y be a nonempty basic open set, where F is a valid rooted r\u2011ball (i.e., occurs somewhere in Y). Start with a copy of H:=F as a rooted subgraph; let L_r be its boundary. If |L_r|<2, extend outward by one or two layers (adding new vertices only outside L_r) until the new outer boundary has at least two vertices; denote the resulting ball still by H (this does not affect membership in U_F^Y since B_r remains F). Use Lemma\u00a04 to build an infinite connected supergraph G_1\u2287H with max degree \u2264D, adding no H\u2013H edges.\nNext, prepare two external interfaces: choose two distinct boundary vertices s,t\u2208L_r (possible by the adjustment above). By Lemma\u00a04\u2019s construction, s and t each received at least one new edge to the outside; let s',t' be the first new neighbours of s,t outside H. In the attached backbone (the subdivided ladder R), there is a simple path Q between s' and t'. Now, for every edge e of H, pick s_e\u2208L_r so that the unique H\u2011path from the root to s_e contains e (this exists for tree\u2011edges by choosing s_e in the corresponding branch; cycle\u2011edges lie on an H\u2011cycle already). Consider the H\u2011path P_e from s_e to t (concatenating the root\u2013s_e path (which contains e) and a root\u2013t path). Then the closed walk C_e := s_e s'_e \u00b7 Q(s'_e,t') \u00b7 t't \u00b7 P_e in G_1 is a cycle that contains e. Therefore every edge of H lies on some cycle in the resulting graph. Edges added outside H lie in cycles because the backbone is 2\u2011edge\u2011connected and attachments from two distinct boundary vertices s,t supply two edge\u2011disjoint routes into R. Hence the final graph G is bridgeless, has max degree \u2264D, and contains an occurrence of F as an r\u2011ball. Thus U_F^Y meets the bridgeless set. \u220e\nRemark. The proof uses only D\u22653 (the backbone is degree\u2011\u22643). All modifications occur strictly outside the original r\u2011ball, so the occurrence of F is preserved.\n\nConsequences for coarser/pullback topologies\n- By Lemma\u00a01 and Proposition\u00a05, in Y (and hence in the pullback topology \u03c4_any on X via \u03c0) the bridgeless set is dense for all D\u22653. In \u2264D (any D\u22652), the complement contains the open set \u201cthere exists a leaf\u201d, so bridgeless is not comeagre in Y (nor in \u03c4_any). Thus, in \u2264D, bridgeless is nowhere dense under d_\u2022 (Theorem\u00a014) but not typical under \u03c4_any either; category differs (nowhere dense vs. not comeagre, dense), although \u201ctypicality\u201d status agrees (non\u2011typical in both).\n- In =D, D even, Theorem\u00a03 shows bridgeless is comeagre in both X and Y (hence also in \u03c4_any). In =D, D odd, the no\u2011go from bridge\u2011forcing cylinders still applies to any cylinder\u2011refining Baire topology on X (bridgeless cannot be comeagre).\n\nGeneral no\u2011go for cylinder\u2011refining Baire topologies\nProposition 6. Let \u03c4 be any Baire topology on X such that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is \u03c4\u2011open. Then:\n- In \u2264D, the set \u201chas a bridge\u201d contains the nonempty \u03c4\u2011open cylinder where the root is a leaf; hence \u201cbridgeless\u201d is not comeagre.\n- In =D with odd D, refinements as in Proposition\u00a0C (\u03b4=1 boundary) yield a nonempty \u03c4\u2011open set contained in \u201chas a bridge\u201d; again \u201cbridgeless\u201d is not comeagre.\nProof. Nonempty \u03c4\u2011open subsets cannot be meagre in a Baire space. \u220e\n\nSmall example (D=3)\nLet F be the r\u2011ball of a path of length 2r in the cubic case (a typical tree\u2011like ball). The boundary L_r has \u22652 vertices. Attach one new outside neighbour to each of two distinct boundary vertices s,t, and embed a long finite segment of a subdivided ladder between these attachment points. Every edge on the unique root\u2013s path (and similarly root\u2013t path) lies on a cycle obtained by going out via s, across the ladder, and back via t; thus no bridges remain in the union. Degrees remain \u22643, and B_r is unchanged.\n\nNext steps\n- Move Lemma\u00a01 (Y is Baire) and Theorem\u00a03 (even\u2011D regular: bridgeless comeagre) into proofs.md.\n- Write a full, explicit version of Proposition\u00a05 with a precise choice of the 2\u2011edge\u2011connected backbone (subdivided ladder), an attachment scheme that uses at most one new edge per boundary vertex, and a cycle\u2011covering argument for all H\u2011edges.\n- Extend Proposition\u00a06 to a larger class of \u201cfinite\u2011lens/pattern\u2011compatible\u201d topologies explicitly, and record hypotheses under which the argument applies.\n- Investigate whether there exists a natural Baire topology on X strictly coarser than \u03c4_any in which \u201cbridgeless\u201d becomes comeagre for \u2264D (likely impossible if every \u201cleaf somewhere\u201d set remains open), or prove an impossibility theorem formalizing this no\u2011go.\n- For completeness, include the odd\u2011D \u03b4=1 gadget proof (unique cross\u2011edge at the boundary) and the even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing cylinder in proofs.md, as they underpin Proposition\u00a06.\n"
