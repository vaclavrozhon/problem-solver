Ideas
- Consolidate Conjecture 1 by adding a short proof that the unrooted space Y (rootless local topology) is Baire via the forgetful map π:X→Y. This lets us pull typicality statements between X and Y for saturated properties.
- Close the gap “D=3 bridgeless dense in Y”: give a constructive, degree‑bounded, 2‑edge‑connected completion procedure that, starting from any valid finite r‑ball F, builds an infinite bridgeless graph of maximum degree ≤ D (D≥3) containing an occurrence of F. This removes a previous open point and strengthens the coarser‑topology analysis.
- Record a simple parity+Theorem 16 proof that in =D with even D, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under d_• (and in Y), complementing the odd‑D no‑go.
- Extract a general no‑go principle: on any Baire topology on X in which rooted cylinders are open, bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre in ≤D (and in =D for odd D) because “has a (1‑way) bridge” contains a nonempty open cylinder.

Baire property of the unrooted space
Lemma 1. Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the rooted local topology and Y the unrooted degree‑bounded space with the rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. Then Y is a Baire space.
Proof. The forgetful map π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open and surjective (preimage/image of a cylinder is a cylinder). Let (U_n)_n be dense open in Y. Then π^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X, hence ⋂_n π^{-1}(U_n) is dense in X. For any nonempty open W⊆Y, π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X and intersects ⋂_n π^{-1}(U_n). Applying π (which is open), we get W∩⋂_n U_n≠∅. ∎

Even‑regular typicality
Lemma 2 (Cut‑size parity for finite subgraphs). If H is a finite induced subgraph of a D‑regular graph G, then |δ_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)| is even.
Proof. Sum degrees in G over V(H): D|V(H)|=2|E(H)|+|δ_G(V(H))|. ∎
Theorem 3. In X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4 (and likewise in Y), the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre under the standard topology.
Proof. Theorem 16 gives that graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge form a meagre set in X; by Corollary 3 (meagreness transfer for Baire‑property sets via π), the same holds in Y. In even‑regular graphs, 1‑way infinite bridges are parity‑forbidden by Lemma 2 (applied to the finite component). Hence “has a bridge” is meagre, and its complement “bridgeless” is comeagre. ∎

Degree‑completion tool
Lemma 4 (Degree completion to an infinite D‑bounded supergraph). Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree ≤ D and D≥3. Then there exists a connected infinite supergraph G⊇H with max degree ≤ D such that no new edges are added between vertices of H.
Proof (sketch). Build an infinite 2‑edge‑connected “backbone” R of maximum degree ≤3 (e.g., the infinite ladder; to keep degrees ≤3 upon attachments, first subdivide every edge of the ladder once, producing many degree‑2 vertices). Enumerate the boundary “stubs” of H: the multiset S={ (v,i): 1≤i≤D−deg_H(v) }. For each s∈S, attach a new path of length ≥1 from v to a distinct degree‑2 vertex of the subdivided ladder, using fresh vertices; this raises v’s degree by 1 and that ladder vertex’s degree to 3, keeping degrees ≤D. Do this so the attachments are disjoint outside H; the result is connected and infinite, with max degree ≤D, and no new H–H edges. ∎

Bridgeless density in Y for D≥3
Proposition 5. Fix D≥3. In the unrooted space Y with max degree ≤D, the set of bridgeless graphs is dense.
Proof. Let U_F^Y be a nonempty basic open set, where F is a valid rooted r‑ball (i.e., occurs somewhere in Y). Start with a copy of H:=F as a rooted subgraph; let L_r be its boundary. If |L_r|<2, extend outward by one or two layers (adding new vertices only outside L_r) until the new outer boundary has at least two vertices; denote the resulting ball still by H (this does not affect membership in U_F^Y since B_r remains F). Use Lemma 4 to build an infinite connected supergraph G_1⊇H with max degree ≤D, adding no H–H edges.
Next, prepare two external interfaces: choose two distinct boundary vertices s,t∈L_r (possible by the adjustment above). By Lemma 4’s construction, s and t each received at least one new edge to the outside; let s',t' be the first new neighbours of s,t outside H. In the attached backbone (the subdivided ladder R), there is a simple path Q between s' and t'. Now, for every edge e of H, pick s_e∈L_r so that the unique H‑path from the root to s_e contains e (this exists for tree‑edges by choosing s_e in the corresponding branch; cycle‑edges lie on an H‑cycle already). Consider the H‑path P_e from s_e to t (concatenating the root–s_e path (which contains e) and a root–t path). Then the closed walk C_e := s_e s'_e · Q(s'_e,t') · t't · P_e in G_1 is a cycle that contains e. Therefore every edge of H lies on some cycle in the resulting graph. Edges added outside H lie in cycles because the backbone is 2‑edge‑connected and attachments from two distinct boundary vertices s,t supply two edge‑disjoint routes into R. Hence the final graph G is bridgeless, has max degree ≤D, and contains an occurrence of F as an r‑ball. Thus U_F^Y meets the bridgeless set. ∎
Remark. The proof uses only D≥3 (the backbone is degree‑≤3). All modifications occur strictly outside the original r‑ball, so the occurrence of F is preserved.

Consequences for coarser/pullback topologies
- By Lemma 1 and Proposition 5, in Y (and hence in the pullback topology τ_any on X via π) the bridgeless set is dense for all D≥3. In ≤D (any D≥2), the complement contains the open set “there exists a leaf”, so bridgeless is not comeagre in Y (nor in τ_any). Thus, in ≤D, bridgeless is nowhere dense under d_• (Theorem 14) but not typical under τ_any either; category differs (nowhere dense vs. not comeagre, dense), although “typicality” status agrees (non‑typical in both).
- In =D, D even, Theorem 3 shows bridgeless is comeagre in both X and Y (hence also in τ_any). In =D, D odd, the no‑go from bridge‑forcing cylinders still applies to any cylinder‑refining Baire topology on X (bridgeless cannot be comeagre).

General no‑go for cylinder‑refining Baire topologies
Proposition 6. Let τ be any Baire topology on X such that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is τ‑open. Then:
- In ≤D, the set “has a bridge” contains the nonempty τ‑open cylinder where the root is a leaf; hence “bridgeless” is not comeagre.
- In =D with odd D, refinements as in Proposition C (δ=1 boundary) yield a nonempty τ‑open set contained in “has a bridge”; again “bridgeless” is not comeagre.
Proof. Nonempty τ‑open subsets cannot be meagre in a Baire space. ∎

Small example (D=3)
Let F be the r‑ball of a path of length 2r in the cubic case (a typical tree‑like ball). The boundary L_r has ≥2 vertices. Attach one new outside neighbour to each of two distinct boundary vertices s,t, and embed a long finite segment of a subdivided ladder between these attachment points. Every edge on the unique root–s path (and similarly root–t path) lies on a cycle obtained by going out via s, across the ladder, and back via t; thus no bridges remain in the union. Degrees remain ≤3, and B_r is unchanged.

Next steps
- Move Lemma 1 (Y is Baire) and Theorem 3 (even‑D regular: bridgeless comeagre) into proofs.md.
- Write a full, explicit version of Proposition 5 with a precise choice of the 2‑edge‑connected backbone (subdivided ladder), an attachment scheme that uses at most one new edge per boundary vertex, and a cycle‑covering argument for all H‑edges.
- Extend Proposition 6 to a larger class of “finite‑lens/pattern‑compatible” topologies explicitly, and record hypotheses under which the argument applies.
- Investigate whether there exists a natural Baire topology on X strictly coarser than τ_any in which “bridgeless” becomes comeagre for ≤D (likely impossible if every “leaf somewhere” set remains open), or prove an impossibility theorem formalizing this no‑go.
- For completeness, include the odd‑D δ=1 gadget proof (unique cross‑edge at the boundary) and the even‑D cut‑vertex forcing cylinder in proofs.md, as they underpin Proposition 6.
