The forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G, satisfies: \u03c0 is continuous (\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{rootings F\u2032 of F} \ud835\udd3e_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032} open), open (\u03c0 maps rooted cylinders onto rootless cylinders), and surjective. Since X is Baire (indeed compact metric), Y is Baire as a continuous open image of a Baire space (Oxtoby).\n- Proposition A2 (Root-invariance via \u03c0).\nFor any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080) iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4_\u2022). If A has the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nReason: continuity+openness yield int(cl(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(int(cl(A))). Meagreness transfers via dense G_\u03b4 witnesses and openness.\nUse: Resolves Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (all A) and meagreness for BP sets.\n\nB) Finite pinning frameworks (FLP/FPP) and gadgets (Conj. 2 no-go)\n\n- Definitions.\nFLP (finite-lens property): every nonempty open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) that pins the radius-r neighborhoods of finitely many marked vertices. FPP (finite pinning property): every nonempty open O contains some FLP-cylinder W(M)\u2286O.\n- Theorem B1 (Bridgeless nowhere dense under FLP; \u2264D and =D odd).\nFor D\u22653, in any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\bullet,\u2264D}, BrFree is nowhere dense by pinning a leaf z at a boundary vertex b with residual capacity, forcing bz to be a bridge in all completions. For \ud835\udd3e_{\\bullet,=D} with odd D, use the explicit pinned seed S: take K_{D+2} with vertices x,a,b,W (|W|=D\u22121), delete xa,xb and a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D\u22121, others D, S connected. Pin all radius-1 neighborhoods of S far from any marks. In any D-regular completion exactly one cross edge must attach to x, hence that edge is a bridge. Thus BrFree is nowhere dense.\n- Proposition B2 (Even-D regular: NoCut nowhere dense under FLP/FPP).\nFor even D\u22654, pin S\u2032: start from K_{D,D} on A\u222aB, pick x\u2208A and y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B; delete x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082 and add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082. Then deg_{S\u2032}(x)=D\u22122, others D, and S\u2032 connected. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods. In any D-regular completion all cross edges are forced through x; removing x disconnects, so \u201cno cut vertex\u201d is nowhere dense.\n- Proposition B3 (Refinement monotonicity).\nIf \u03c4\u2082 refines \u03c4\u2081 and S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2081), then S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2082). Thus no finer metric can make BrFree typical.\n\nC) Unrooted space Y: bridgeless remains small; occurrence pullbacks (Conj. 2, extended no-go)\n\n- Proposition C1 (BrFree is nowhere dense in Y for \u2264D and =D odd).\nGiven any nonempty rootless cylinder U_F^Y, refine to U_{F\u2032}^Y by embedding the same finite pinned gadgets entirely inside F\u2032 (far from the center), ensuring a bridge in every completion. Hence BrFree is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080).\n- Corollary C2 (Occurrence-pullback topologies on X).\nFor \u03c4_occ generated by Occ(F)=\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y), BrFree is nowhere dense; thus any root-insensitive occurrence-based metric cannot make BrFree typical.\n\nD) Even-regular classification: bridgeless is typical (new crisp theorem)\n\n- Theorem D1 (Even D-regular, D\u22654: BrFree is comeagre in X and Y).\nIn \ud835\udd3e_{\\bullet,=D} with even D\u22654, 1-way infinite bridges are parity-forbidden (a finite side S would give |\u03b4(S)|\u2261D|S| (mod 2)=0, contradicting |\u03b4(S)|=1). By Theorem 16, graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge form a meagre (but not nowhere dense) subset. Therefore the complement BrFree is comeagre in both the rooted space X and the unrooted space Y (by \u03c0-transfer for BP sets and Y\u2019s Baire property).\n\nE) Bridgeless vs. 2-way bridges: technique underlying Theorem 16 (supporting lemma)\n\n- Lemma E1 (Eliminating bridges near the root by 2-edge-connected replacements).\nFix k and D>2. For any cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\\bullet}^{F}, refine to \ud835\udd3e_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032} by replacing each edge of the k-ball by a 2-edge-connected \u0398-gadget (three internally disjoint length-\u22652 paths) whose attachments preserve degrees (use internal degree-regularization within the gadget). Then no edge within distance \u2264k is a bridge in any completion, and the refinement remains nonempty. Hence \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense; meagreness follows by a countable union over k.\nWhy useful: Canonical method to prove Theorem 16\u2019s \u201cnowhere dense per k\u201d step while respecting degree bounds.\n\nF) Bounded re-rooting invariance for section metrics (robustness)\n\n- Lemma F1 (Uniformly bounded re-rooting gives homeomorphic section metrics).\nIf root selectors s,t:Y\u2192X satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; indeed d_t\u22642^{K}d_s and d_s\u22642^{K}d_t. Thus typicality is invariant under bounded root changes.\n\nExamples\n\n- D=3 (odd): Take K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w\u2081,w\u2082; delete xa, xb, and w\u2081w\u2082. Pin radius-1. Only x has residual capacity, forcing exactly one cross edge and hence a bridge in every 3-regular completion.\n- D=4 (even): In K_{4,4} with parts A,B, pick x\u2208A and y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B; delete x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082; add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082; pin radius-1. Only x can accept external edges; removing x disconnects \u2192 cut vertex.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n\n- Meagreness equivalence via \u03c0 requires BP; we avoid claims for arbitrary A\u2286Y.\n- Any metric/topology with FPP/FLP (and any finer topology) cannot make BrFree typical. A positive answer to Conjecture 2 would require a natural, Baire, non-FPP metric.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move Lemma A1 and Proposition A2 to proofs.md (settles Conjecture 1 in the intended scope).\n- Add Theorem D1 (even-regular: BrFree comeagre) to proofs.md and output.md.\n- Include detailed pinning proofs of Theorem B1 and Proposition B2 (explicit gadgets with degree checks) and Lemma E1 (\u0398-replacement scheme) in proofs.md.\n- Explore non-FPP, Baire metrics (e.g., end-structure/topological end-refinement) and test the category of BrFree therein; either produce a candidate where BrFree is comeagre or extend the no-go.\n"
