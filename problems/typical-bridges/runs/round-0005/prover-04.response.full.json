I know I need to find an open set where all subopens can realize a two-way infinite bridge by adding distant rays. Alternatively, for any open cylinder, I can show that it can be extended to contain a two-way infinite bridge within a certain distance. However, the earlier claim suggests that having a two-way infinite bridge at distance k is considered nowhere dense, which seems contradictory since the union over k should yield meager but not nowhere dense results.",

The forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G, satisfies: \u03c0 is continuous (\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{rootings F\u2032 of F} \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{F\u2032} open), open (\u03c0 maps rooted cylinders onto rootless cylinders), and surjective. Since X is Baire (indeed compact metric), Y is Baire as a continuous open image of a Baire space (Oxtoby).\\n- Proposition A2 (Root-invariance via \u03c0).\\nFor any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080) iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4_\u2022). If A has the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\\nReason: continuity+openness yield int(cl(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(int(cl(A))). Meagreness transfers via dense G_\u03b4 witnesses and openness.\\nUse: Resolves Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (all A) and meagreness for BP sets.\\n\\nB) Finite pinning frameworks (FLP/FPP) and gadgets (Conj. 2 no-go)\\n\\n- Definitions.\\nFLP (finite-lens property): every nonempty open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) that pins the radius-r neighborhoods of finitely many marked vertices. FPP (finite pinning property): every nonempty open O contains some FLP-cylinder W(M)\u2286O.\\n- Theorem B1 (Bridgeless nowhere dense under FLP; \u2264D and =D odd).\\nFor D\u22653, in any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D}, BrFree is nowhere dense by pinning a leaf z at a boundary vertex b with residual capacity, forcing bz to be a bridge in all completions. For \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D} with odd D, use the explicit pinned seed S: take K_{D+2} with vertices x,a,b,W (|W|=D\u22121), delete xa,xb and a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D\u22121, others D, S connected. Pin all radius-1 neighborhoods of S far from any marks. In any D-regular completion exactly one cross edge must attach to x, hence that edge is a bridge. Thus BrFree is nowhere dense.\\n- Proposition B2 (Even-D regular: NoCut nowhere dense under FLP/FPP).\\nFor even D\u22654, pin S\u2032: start from K_{D,D} on A\u222aB, pick x\u2208A and y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B; delete x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082 and add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082. Then deg_{S\u2032}(x)=D\u22122, others D, and S\u2032 connected. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods. In any D-regular completion all cross edges are forced through x; removing x disconnects, so \u201cno cut vertex\u201d is nowhere dense.\\n- Proposition B3 (Refinement monotonicity).\\nIf \u03c4\u2082 refines \u03c4\u2081 and S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2081), then S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2082). Thus no finer metric can make BrFree typical.\\n\\nC) Unrooted space Y: bridgeless remains small; occurrence pullbacks (Conj. 2, extended no-go)\\n\\n- Proposition C1 (BrFree is nowhere dense in Y for \u2264D and =D odd).\\nGiven any nonempty rootless cylinder U_F^Y, refine to U_{F\u2032}^Y by embedding the same finite pinned gadgets entirely inside F\u2032 (far from the center), ensuring a bridge in every completion. Hence BrFree is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080).\\n- Corollary C2 (Occurrence-pullback topologies on X).\\nFor \u03c4_occ generated by Occ(F)=\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y), BrFree is nowhere dense; thus any root-insensitive occurrence-based metric cannot make BrFree typical.\\n\\nD) Even-regular classification: bridgeless is typical (new crisp theorem)\\n\\n- Theorem D1 (Even D-regular, D\u22654: BrFree is comeagre in X and Y).\\nIn \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D\u22654, 1-way infinite bridges are parity-forbidden (a finite side S would give |\u03b4(S)|\u2261D|S| (mod 2)=0, contradicting |\u03b4(S)|=1). By Theorem 16, graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge form a meagre (but not nowhere dense) subset. Therefore the complement BrFree is comeagre in both the rooted space X and the unrooted space Y (by \u03c0-transfer for BP sets and Y\u2019s Baire property).\\n\\nE) Bridgeless vs. 2-way bridges: technique underlying Theorem 16 (supporting lemma)\\n\\n- Lemma E1 (Eliminating bridges near the root by 2-edge-connected replacements).\\nFix k and D>2. For any cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{F}, refine to \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{F\u2032} by replacing each edge of the k-ball by a 2-edge-connected \u0398-gadget (three internally disjoint length-\u22652 paths) whose attachments preserve degrees (use internal degree-regularization within the gadget). Then no edge within distance \u2264k is a bridge in any completion, and the refinement remains nonempty. Hence \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense; meagreness follows by a countable union over k.\\nWhy useful: Canonical method to prove Theorem 16\u2019s \u201cnowhere dense per k\u201d step while respecting degree bounds.\\n\\nF) Bounded re-rooting invariance for section metrics (robustness)\\n\\n- Lemma F1 (Uniformly bounded re-rooting gives homeomorphic section metrics).\\nIf root selectors s,t:Y\u2192X satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; indeed d_t\u22642^{K}d_s and d_s\u22642^{K}d_t. Thus typicality is invariant under bounded root changes.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- D=3 (odd): Take K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w\u2081,w\u2082; delete xa, xb, and w\u2081w\u2082. Pin radius-1. Only x has residual capacity, forcing exactly one cross edge and hence a bridge in every 3-regular completion.\\n- D=4 (even): In K_{4,4} with parts A,B, pick x\u2208A and y\u2081,y\u2082\u2208B; delete x\u2212y\u2081,x\u2212y\u2082; add y\u2081\u2212y\u2082; pin radius-1. Only x can accept external edges; removing x disconnects \u2192 cut vertex.\\n\\nObstacles and cautions\\n\\n- Meagreness equivalence via \u03c0 requires BP; we avoid claims for arbitrary A\u2286Y.\\n- Any metric/topology with FPP/FLP (and any finer topology) cannot make BrFree typical. A positive answer to Conjecture 2 would require a natural, Baire, non-FPP metric.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Move Lemma A1 and Proposition A2 to proofs.md (settles Conjecture 1 in the intended scope).\\n- Add Theorem D1 (even-regular: BrFree comeagre) to proofs.md and output.md.\\n- Include detailed pinning proofs of Theorem B1 and Proposition B2 (explicit gadgets with degree checks) and Lemma E1 (\u0398-replacement scheme) in proofs.md.\\n- Explore non-FPP, Baire metrics (e.g., end-structure/topological end-refinement) and test the category of BrFree therein; either produce a candidate where BrFree is comeagre or extend the no-go.\\n\"}",
