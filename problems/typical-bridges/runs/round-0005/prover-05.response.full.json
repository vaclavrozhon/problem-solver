This consolidates the root\u2011invariance of smallness for all natural properties.\\n- Settle the even\u2011D regular case: prove that bridgeless graphs are comeagre in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} for even D\u22654 (1\u2011way bridges parity\u2011forbidden; 2\u2011way bridges meagre). This completes the typicality classification for bridges in the BS topology.\\n- Record a clean density proof for the set \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d (both in \u2264D and in =D), justifying the \u201cnot nowhere dense\u201d part of Theorem 16 by exhibiting density.\\n\\nQuotient map framework (Conjecture 1)\\n\\nLet X=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm (BS) topology and let Y be the space of unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with the same degree constraint, endowed with the rootless\u2011local topology generated by U_F^Y={G\u2208Y: \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y be \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\\n\\nLemma 1 (\u03c0 is an open quotient). \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective; U\u2286Y is open iff \u03c0^{-1}(U) is open in X.\\nProof. For any rooted r\u2011ball F, \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{v} \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{(F,v)} is open. Every open subset of X is a union of rooted cylinders; its image is a union of rootless cylinders, hence open. Surjectivity is trivial.\\n\\nLemma 2 (closure transport). For all A\u2286Y, \u03c0^{-1}(\\\\overline{A}^Y)=\\\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X.\\nProof. Closed sets in Y are exactly those whose preimage under \u03c0 is closed; intersecting over all closed supersets of A yields the identity.\\n\\nTheorem 3 (nowhere\u2011dense equivalence). A\u2286Y is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\\nProof. If A is nowhere dense then int_Y(\\\\overline{A}^Y)=\u2205. If U\u2286X is nonempty open with U\u2286\\\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X, then \u03c0(U) is nonempty open (Lemma 1) and \u03c0(U)\u2286\\\\overline{A}^Y (Lemma 2), contradiction. The converse is analogous.\\n\\nCorollary 4 (meagreness equivalence for BP sets). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\\nProof. (\u21d2) Preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then \u2203 nonempty open V\u2286Y with A\u2229V comeagre in V. Write V\\\\(A\u2229V)\u2286\u22c3 N_i with N_i nowhere dense. In \u03c0^{-1}(V), each \u03c0^{-1}(N_i) is nowhere dense by Theorem 3, so \u03c0^{-1}(A\u2229V)=\u03c0^{-1}(V)\\\\\u22c3 \u03c0^{-1}(N_i) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of \u03c0^{-1}(A).\\n\\nLemma 5 (Y is Baire). Y is a Baire space.\\nProof. Continuous open surjections map Baire spaces to Baire spaces: given dense open D_n\u2286Y, each \u03c0^{-1}(D_n) is dense open in X (openness shows density of preimages), hence \u22c2_n \u03c0^{-1}(D_n) is dense in Baire X, so \u22c2_n D_n\u2260\u2205.\\n\\nEven\u2011D regular case: bridgeless is comeagre\\n\\nTheorem 6. In \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} for even D\u22654, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.\\nProof. In a D\u2011regular graph with even D, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component S with exactly one cross edge. But for any finite S, the number of edges leaving S equals \u03a3_{v\u2208S}(D\u2212deg_S(v))=D|S|\u22122|E(S)|, which is even when D is even; hence no 1\u2011way infinite bridge exists. Therefore \u201chas a bridge\u201d = \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d in this space. By Theorem 16, the latter set is meagre, so its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\\n\\nDensity of the 2\u2011way infinite bridge property (supports Theorem 16: \u201cnot nowhere dense\u201d)\\n\\nProposition 7 (\u2264D case). For any D\u22653, in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} the set A of graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense.\\nProof. Fix a rooted r\u2011ball F and \u03b5>0. Build an extension H as follows. Choose a boundary vertex u (distance r). Attach a simple path P of length L\u226br starting from u using fresh vertices, respecting degree bound \u2264D by making each new interior vertex of P have two path neighbors and at most D\u22122 additional leaves (to be added later if needed) to keep degrees \u2264D. At the far end x of P, create two infinite components L and R: for instance, attach two infinite (D\u22121)\u2011ary trees to x via a new vertex y adjacent only to x (so x\u2013y forms an edge e), and saturate degrees elsewhere by adding leaves so that degrees stay \u2264D and both components are infinite. By construction, e is the only edge between the two infinite parts; removing e disconnects H into two infinite components. Since F was preserved inside radius r, H lies in the cylinder \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, proving density.\\n\\nProposition 8 (=D case). For any D\u22653, in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} the set A of graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense.\\nProof sketch. Given F, extend it outside radius r by a long simple path P of length L from a boundary vertex u, and at each new interior vertex z of P attach D\u22122 disjoint D\u2011regular \u201cdegree\u2011saturating\u201d finite gadgets (e.g., copies of K_{D+1}\u2212e pinned so that z gains exactly one new neighbor per gadget, all gadgets internally D\u2011regular) to keep deg(z)=D. At the terminal vertex x of P, introduce a new vertex y and set e=xy to be the prospective bridge. Now grow two disjoint infinite D\u2011regular components L and R from x and y, respectively, using an iterative degree\u2011completion process: whenever a vertex has residual degree r\u2208{1,\u2026,D\u22121}, attach a fresh copy of K_{D+1}\u2212e and identify one deficit port to raise its degree by 1 while keeping all new vertices at degree D; proceed along a spanning tree to infinity on each side to ensure the components are infinite. No edges are added between the two sides except e. All vertices (including x,y) have degree D at the end. Then e is a bridge whose removal leaves two infinite components. Since F is unchanged within B_r, the constructed graph lies in \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, proving density.\\n\\nRemarks on gadgets used above\\n\\n- The port gadget Q_D=K_{D+1}\u2212e has two deficit vertices of degree D\u22121 and all others degree D; gluing its deficit vertices to a given vertex raises its degree by 1 while keeping all new vertices at degree D. This provides a local degree\u2011completion tool in D\u2011regular constructions.\\n- Degree\u2011bounded case admits the simpler tree/leaf attachments because only the upper bound \u0394\u2264D needs to be respected.\\n\\nWhy useful here: Propositions 7\u20138 provide the \u201cnot nowhere dense\u201d half of Theorem 16 by showing that the 2\u2011way infinite bridge property is dense (hence its closure has nonempty interior), while meagreness follows by the standard \u201cdistance\u2011k occurrence\u201d decomposition.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Parity check for even D. For D=4 and any finite S, edges leaving S count to 4|S|\u22122|E(S)|, even; hence no 1\u2011way infinite bridge can split off a finite S.\\n- Odd D regular, D=3. The Q_3 gadget (K_4\u2212e) reduces boundary deficit by 2 per application; iterative use forces \u03b4=1 in a finite refinement, yielding exactly one cross edge in any 3\u2011regular completion and hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge (Theorem 14(ii) forcing scheme).\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Meagreness transfer beyond Baire\u2011property sets is generally false for quotients; our results explicitly restrict to sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), which covers all properties under consideration.\\n- While density of 2\u2011way infinite bridges is established, giving the full formal write\u2011up of the regular completion (Proposition 8) requires a compact degree\u2011completion lemma (e.g., via Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai) to ensure simple graphs; the sketched gadget\u2011based completion is standard but should be detailed in proofs.md.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Move Lemmas 1\u20132, Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Lemma 5 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 (nowhere\u2011denseness and meagreness for BP sets are root\u2011invariant; Y is Baire).\\n- Add a full proof of Theorem 6 (even\u2011D regular bridgeless is comeagre) to output.md and proofs.md.\\n- Write the detailed gadget\u2011based regular completion for Proposition 8: formalize the use of Q_D attachments to realize any finite pattern with prescribed localized deficits and extend to infinite D\u2011regular components while keeping e the unique cross edge.\\n- For Conjecture 2, keep the no\u2011go region: any topology with rooted cylinders as a base preserves typicality (bridgeless remains nowhere dense for \u2264D and odd D). Investigate a specific coarser \u201ctail\u201d topology; we already observed that both bridgeful and bridgeless sets have nonempty interior there. If the tail space is Baire, neither set can be comeagre, precluding bridgeless typicality in that topology as well. Prove (or refute) Baire\u2011ness of the tail topology via an inverse\u2011limit or quotient construction.\\n\"}",
