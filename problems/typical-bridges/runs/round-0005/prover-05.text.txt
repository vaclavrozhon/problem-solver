Ideas

- Finalize Conjecture 1 rigorously via the quotient map π from rooted to unrooted spaces: prove nowhere‑denseness equivalence; prove meagreness equivalence for sets with the Baire property; deduce Y is Baire. This consolidates the root‑invariance of smallness for all natural properties.
- Settle the even‑D regular case: prove that bridgeless graphs are comeagre in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} for even D≥4 (1‑way bridges parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges meagre). This completes the typicality classification for bridges in the BS topology.
- Record a clean density proof for the set “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” (both in ≤D and in =D), justifying the “not nowhere dense” part of Theorem 16 by exhibiting density.

Quotient map framework (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) topology and let Y be the space of unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with the same degree constraint, endowed with the rootless‑local topology generated by U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. Let π:X→Y be π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is an open quotient). π is continuous, open, surjective; U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open in X.
Proof. For any rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v} \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{(F,v)} is open. Every open subset of X is a union of rooted cylinders; its image is a union of rootless cylinders, hence open. Surjectivity is trivial.

Lemma 2 (closure transport). For all A⊆Y, π^{-1}(\overline{A}^Y)=\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X.
Proof. Closed sets in Y are exactly those whose preimage under π is closed; intersecting over all closed supersets of A yields the identity.

Theorem 3 (nowhere‑dense equivalence). A⊆Y is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. If A is nowhere dense then int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)=∅. If U⊆X is nonempty open with U⊆\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X, then π(U) is nonempty open (Lemma 1) and π(U)⊆\overline{A}^Y (Lemma 2), contradiction. The converse is analogous.

Corollary 4 (meagreness equivalence for BP sets). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y with A∩V comeagre in V. Write V\(A∩V)⊆⋃ N_i with N_i nowhere dense. In π^{-1}(V), each π^{-1}(N_i) is nowhere dense by Theorem 3, so π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(V)\⋃ π^{-1}(N_i) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of π^{-1}(A).

Lemma 5 (Y is Baire). Y is a Baire space.
Proof. Continuous open surjections map Baire spaces to Baire spaces: given dense open D_n⊆Y, each π^{-1}(D_n) is dense open in X (openness shows density of preimages), hence ⋂_n π^{-1}(D_n) is dense in Baire X, so ⋂_n D_n≠∅.

Even‑D regular case: bridgeless is comeagre

Theorem 6. In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} for even D≥4, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
Proof. In a D‑regular graph with even D, a 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component S with exactly one cross edge. But for any finite S, the number of edges leaving S equals Σ_{v∈S}(D−deg_S(v))=D|S|−2|E(S)|, which is even when D is even; hence no 1‑way infinite bridge exists. Therefore “has a bridge” = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” in this space. By Theorem 16, the latter set is meagre, so its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Density of the 2‑way infinite bridge property (supports Theorem 16: “not nowhere dense”)

Proposition 7 (≤D case). For any D≥3, in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D} the set A of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof. Fix a rooted r‑ball F and ε>0. Build an extension H as follows. Choose a boundary vertex u (distance r). Attach a simple path P of length L≫r starting from u using fresh vertices, respecting degree bound ≤D by making each new interior vertex of P have two path neighbors and at most D−2 additional leaves (to be added later if needed) to keep degrees ≤D. At the far end x of P, create two infinite components L and R: for instance, attach two infinite (D−1)‑ary trees to x via a new vertex y adjacent only to x (so x–y forms an edge e), and saturate degrees elsewhere by adding leaves so that degrees stay ≤D and both components are infinite. By construction, e is the only edge between the two infinite parts; removing e disconnects H into two infinite components. Since F was preserved inside radius r, H lies in the cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, proving density.

Proposition 8 (=D case). For any D≥3, in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} the set A of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof sketch. Given F, extend it outside radius r by a long simple path P of length L from a boundary vertex u, and at each new interior vertex z of P attach D−2 disjoint D‑regular “degree‑saturating” finite gadgets (e.g., copies of K_{D+1}−e pinned so that z gains exactly one new neighbor per gadget, all gadgets internally D‑regular) to keep deg(z)=D. At the terminal vertex x of P, introduce a new vertex y and set e=xy to be the prospective bridge. Now grow two disjoint infinite D‑regular components L and R from x and y, respectively, using an iterative degree‑completion process: whenever a vertex has residual degree r∈{1,…,D−1}, attach a fresh copy of K_{D+1}−e and identify one deficit port to raise its degree by 1 while keeping all new vertices at degree D; proceed along a spanning tree to infinity on each side to ensure the components are infinite. No edges are added between the two sides except e. All vertices (including x,y) have degree D at the end. Then e is a bridge whose removal leaves two infinite components. Since F is unchanged within B_r, the constructed graph lies in \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, proving density.

Remarks on gadgets used above

- The port gadget Q_D=K_{D+1}−e has two deficit vertices of degree D−1 and all others degree D; gluing its deficit vertices to a given vertex raises its degree by 1 while keeping all new vertices at degree D. This provides a local degree‑completion tool in D‑regular constructions.
- Degree‑bounded case admits the simpler tree/leaf attachments because only the upper bound Δ≤D needs to be respected.

Why useful here: Propositions 7–8 provide the “not nowhere dense” half of Theorem 16 by showing that the 2‑way infinite bridge property is dense (hence its closure has nonempty interior), while meagreness follows by the standard “distance‑k occurrence” decomposition.

Examples

- Parity check for even D. For D=4 and any finite S, edges leaving S count to 4|S|−2|E(S)|, even; hence no 1‑way infinite bridge can split off a finite S.
- Odd D regular, D=3. The Q_3 gadget (K_4−e) reduces boundary deficit by 2 per application; iterative use forces δ=1 in a finite refinement, yielding exactly one cross edge in any 3‑regular completion and hence a 1‑way infinite bridge (Theorem 14(ii) forcing scheme).

Obstacles

- Meagreness transfer beyond Baire‑property sets is generally false for quotients; our results explicitly restrict to sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), which covers all properties under consideration.
- While density of 2‑way infinite bridges is established, giving the full formal write‑up of the regular completion (Proposition 8) requires a compact degree‑completion lemma (e.g., via Erdős–Gallai) to ensure simple graphs; the sketched gadget‑based completion is standard but should be detailed in proofs.md.

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Lemma 5 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 (nowhere‑denseness and meagreness for BP sets are root‑invariant; Y is Baire).
- Add a full proof of Theorem 6 (even‑D regular bridgeless is comeagre) to output.md and proofs.md.
- Write the detailed gadget‑based regular completion for Proposition 8: formalize the use of Q_D attachments to realize any finite pattern with prescribed localized deficits and extend to infinite D‑regular components while keeping e the unique cross edge.
- For Conjecture 2, keep the no‑go region: any topology with rooted cylinders as a base preserves typicality (bridgeless remains nowhere dense for ≤D and odd D). Investigate a specific coarser “tail” topology; we already observed that both bridgeful and bridgeless sets have nonempty interior there. If the tail space is Baire, neither set can be comeagre, precluding bridgeless typicality in that topology as well. Prove (or refute) Baire‑ness of the tail topology via an inverse‑limit or quotient construction.
