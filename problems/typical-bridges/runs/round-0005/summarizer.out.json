  "summary_md": "Last round: Conjecture 1 (root\u2011invariance) was settled for nowhere\u2011denseness via a root\u2011free cylinder\u2011refinement criterion for saturated sets; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (e.g. Borel/analytic). A correction was made: the forgetful map \u03c0 is open and surjective but not continuous for the \u201coccurs\u2011somewhere\u201d unrooted topology, so continuity\u2011based arguments were replaced by the cylinder test. Conjecture 2 admits a strong no\u2011go for any metric whose base is rooted cylinders (they induce the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved). We constructed explicit gadgets: an odd\u2011D parity refinement forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1\u2011way bridge in any D\u2011regular completion) and an even\u2011D refinement forcing a cut vertex; from this we deduced bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D for even D\u22654. A coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) was proposed where 1\u2011way bridges are dense; its Baire/typicality remains open.
