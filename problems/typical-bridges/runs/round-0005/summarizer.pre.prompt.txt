# Open Problem: Resolve the Final Two Conjectures on Typical Properties of Countable Graphs

This note poses two conjectures extracted from the extended abstract **“Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges (extended abstract)”** by Robert Šámal and Hadi Zamani (EUROCOMB’25). We first state the setting precisely and then formulate the conjectures. The authors’ extended abstract (lightly re‑typeset) follows afterward for context.

---

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

## Conjectures

### Conjecture 1 — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

### Conjecture 2 — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

---

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

---

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

---

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.

# Research Notes



Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2

1) Root-invariance (Conjecture 1)
- Spaces: X = G_{\bullet,D} (rooted local topology), Y = unrooted countable connected graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v with B_r(G,v) ≅ F}.
- Forgetful map π: X → Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open, surjective.
- Consequences:
  • Nowhere denseness transfers: A⊆Y is nowhere dense ⇔ π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
  • Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic): A meagre in Y ⇔ π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
  • Hence for any natural property P of unrooted graphs (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.), the smallness/meagreness status of S_P in X is root-invariant.
- Alternative restatement (root-free ND test): For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense ⇔ for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}.
- Caution: Saturating a nowhere dense set need not remain nowhere dense (can become dense meagre). Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.

2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2
- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.
- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.

3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2
- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.
- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.

4) Section metrics on unrooted space
- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show ‘bridgeless’ remains nowhere dense for every section metric.

5) Action items
- Move π-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.
- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.
- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.
- For ‘2-way infinite bridge’ across section metrics, fill in the ‘not nowhere dense’ part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.


Addendum — Odd-D regular bridge gadget and coarser topologies

- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r′-ball F′ with S(F′)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.
- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.


Update — Root-invariance finalized; even-D cut-vertex forcing

- Conjecture 1: We adopt the forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted). π is continuous, open, surjective. For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. For sets A with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Thus smallness/meagreness of S_P is root-invariant for all natural properties considered. Note: without the Baire property, meagreness transfer need not hold; we avoid such claims.

- Odd D-regular (bridge forcing): We keep the δ(F′)=1 parity construction: extend an r-ball F by one layer W, choose t and e_W so that every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Then any D-regular completion has exactly one cross edge—a 1-way infinite bridge.

- Even D-regular (cut vertex forcing): We can refine any cylinder to pin a finite gadget so that all vertices except a designated vertex u have degree D within the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Consequently, in any D-regular completion all cross edges attach to u, making u a cut vertex. One explicit seed: start from K_{D,D}, pick x∈A, y1,y2∈B, delete x−y1 and x−y2, add y1−y2; pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Embedding this seed outward in the ball yields the desired refinement.

- Coarser topologies: For root-insensitive topologies (e.g., d_any/occurrence), graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; bridgeless graphs often are too (proved for D≥4 in Y). Baire/Polish status of these topologies remains the key open point to conclude typicality there.

New observations and clarifications

- Conjecture 1: Using the forgetful map π (rooted→unrooted), we have exact transfer of nowhere‑denseness and, for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), meagreness. Thus smallness/typicality for natural unrooted properties is root‑invariant. Caution: without the Baire property meagreness need not transfer.

- Odd‑D regular: The δ=1 parity gadget is confirmed. From any r‑ball F, add one layer W and choose internal edges so every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1; any D‑regular completion has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge.

- Even‑D regular: A finite refinement can concentrate all boundary deficit at the root (deg D−2) while saturating all other vertices to D. In any D‑regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

- Coarser topologies: Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any metric/topology still containing rooted cylinders as opens (or finite‑pinning) preserves the current typicality; no such topology can make bridgeless typical in ≤D or in =D with odd D.

- Metric caution: Adding an occurrence term to d_• (e.g., d_new = d_C∘Φ + ε d_•) does not change the topology; typicality and nowhere‑denseness remain unchanged under such metrics.

Corrections and consolidated tools

- π map and unrooted topology. The forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted) is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders), but not continuous for the rootless “occurs‑somewhere” topology in general. Thus ND/meagreness equivalences cannot rely on π’s continuity.

- Root‑free ND criterion (Conjecture 1, ND part). For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense iff for every unrooted r‑ball B there exists B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S. This gives a root‑independent test and replaces π‑based continuity arguments.

- Odd‑D regular forcing (bridge). Using a counting layer W, choose t and e_W so all interior vertices are saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Any D‑regular completion adds exactly one cross edge, a 1‑way infinite bridge.

- Even‑D regular forcing (cut vertex). Pin a finite gadget so all vertices except u have degree D in the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Any D‑regular completion attaches both cross edges at u, making u a cut vertex.

- Theorem 16 (distance‑k exclusion). Replace each edge within distance ≤k by a 2‑terminal 2‑edge‑connected Θ‑gadget (preserving endpoint degrees). This forbids bridges within radius k in any extension, proving the ‘nowhere dense per k’ step.

- Even‑D regular classification. In =D with even D, 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge are meagre; hence bridgeless graphs are comeagre.

- Coarser topologies. Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail topologies exhibit density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any topology still containing rooted cylinders (or finite pinning) as opens preserves current typicality (no bridgeless‑typical in ≤D, odd D).

# Main Results



Main interim results toward the conjectures

- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):
  • Nowhere-dense part resolved. For any property P of unrooted graphs, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space iff the corresponding set T_P in the unrooted space is nowhere dense. This uses the forgetful map π (continuous, open, surjective) and yields a root-free cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets.
  • Meagre part resolved for all properties with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic P): S_P is meagre in the rooted space iff T_P is meagre in the unrooted space. Hence smallness is root-invariant for all natural properties considered (bridges, cut vertices, edge-colouring constraints, etc.).

- Metric sensitivity (Conjecture 2):
  • No-go: Any metric that induces the same cylinder (Benjamini–Schramm) topology preserves typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics.
  • Coarser “rootless-local” proximity: For a natural re-rooting–insensitive closeness, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, indicating genuinely different behavior once the topology is coarsened. The Baire status and typicality under such a topology remain open.


New classification in the even-regular case

- In the D-regular space with even D≥4 (Benjamini–Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs are comeagre: 1-way bridges are parity-forbidden, while 2-way bridges form a meagre set. Thus, bridgeless is typical in this regime.


=== Verifier Summary ===

We corrected a core assumption: π is open but not continuous for the unrooted “occurs‑somewhere” topology, so previous ND/meagre equivalences via π must be revised. We adopt a root‑free cylinder criterion for ND of saturated sets, which settles Conjecture 1 (ND part) rigorously. For Conjecture 2, cylinder/finite‑lens topologies cannot change typicality; the odd‑D bridge‑forcing and even‑D cut‑vertex gadgets are now clean. We formalized the distance‑k exclusion for Theorem 16 via Θ‑replacements. New: in =D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre (parity + Theorem 16). Next: analyze Baire properties and category under genuinely coarser root‑insensitive topologies.

- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r′-ball F′ with S(F′)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.
- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.


Update — Root-invariance finalized; even-D cut-vertex forcing

- Conjecture 1: We adopt the forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted). π is continuous, open, surjective. For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. For sets A with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Thus smallness/meagreness of S_P is root-invariant for all natural properties considered. Note: without the Baire property, meagreness transfer need not hold; we avoid such claims.

- Odd D-regular (bridge forcing): We keep the δ(F′)=1 parity construction: extend an r-ball F by one layer W, choose t and e_W so that every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Then any D-regular completion has exactly one cross edge—a 1-way infinite bridge.

- Even D-regular (cut vertex forcing): We can refine any cylinder to pin a finite gadget so that all vertices except a designated vertex u have degree D within the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Consequently, in any D-regular completion all cross edges attach to u, making u a cut vertex. One explicit seed: start from K_{D,D}, pick x∈A, y1,y2∈B, delete x−y1 and x−y2, add y1−y2; pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Embedding this seed outward in the ball yields the desired refinement.

- Coarser topologies: For root-insensitive topologies (e.g., d_any/occurrence), graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; bridgeless graphs often are too (proved for D≥4 in Y). Baire/Polish status of these topologies remains the key open point to conclude typicality there.

New observations and clarifications

- Conjecture 1: Using the forgetful map π (rooted→unrooted), we have exact transfer of nowhere‑denseness and, for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), meagreness. Thus smallness/typicality for natural unrooted properties is root‑invariant. Caution: without the Baire property meagreness need not transfer.

- Odd‑D regular: The δ=1 parity gadget is confirmed. From any r‑ball F, add one layer W and choose internal edges so every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1; any D‑regular completion has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge.

- Even‑D regular: A finite refinement can concentrate all boundary deficit at the root (deg D−2) while saturating all other vertices to D. In any D‑regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

- Coarser topologies: Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any metric/topology still containing rooted cylinders as opens (or finite‑pinning) preserves the current typicality; no such topology can make bridgeless typical in ≤D or in =D with odd D.

- Metric caution: Adding an occurrence term to d_• (e.g., d_new = d_C∘Φ + ε d_•) does not change the topology; typicality and nowhere‑denseness remain unchanged under such metrics.

Corrections and consolidated tools

- π map and unrooted topology. The forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted) is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders), but not continuous for the rootless “occurs‑somewhere” topology in general. Thus ND/meagreness equivalences cannot rely on π’s continuity.

- Root‑free ND criterion (Conjecture 1, ND part). For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense iff for every unrooted r‑ball B there exists B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S. This gives a root‑independent test and replaces π‑based continuity arguments.

- Odd‑D regular forcing (bridge). Using a counting layer W, choose t and e_W so all interior vertices are saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Any D‑regular completion adds exactly one cross edge, a 1‑way infinite bridge.

- Even‑D regular forcing (cut vertex). Pin a finite gadget so all vertices except u have degree D in the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Any D‑regular completion attaches both cross edges at u, making u a cut vertex.

- Theorem 16 (distance‑k exclusion). Replace each edge within distance ≤k by a 2‑terminal 2‑edge‑connected Θ‑gadget (preserving endpoint degrees). This forbids bridges within radius k in any extension, proving the ‘nowhere dense per k’ step.

- Even‑D regular classification. In =D with even D, 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge are meagre; hence bridgeless graphs are comeagre.

- Coarser topologies. Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail topologies exhibit density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any topology still containing rooted cylinders (or finite pinning) as opens preserves current typicality (no bridgeless‑typical in ≤D, odd D).


=== Current Proofs ===

Corrected statements and proofs toward Conjectures 1 and 2

Set‑up
- X = \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs with degree constraint (≤D or =D), equipped with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) topology generated by rooted cylinders \{\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F\}.
- Y: unrooted, countably infinite, connected graphs with the same degree constraint, endowed with the rootless ‘occurs‑somewhere’ topology generated by U_F^Y = { G: ∃v, B_r(G,v) ≅ F } where F is a rooted r‑ball.
- Forgetful map π: X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is surjective and open; not continuous in general).
(i) For any rooted r‑ball F, π(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F)=U_F^Y; hence π is surjective and open.
(ii) π need not be continuous: there exists F and (G,ρ)∈X with G∈U_F^Y but for every s there are H with B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) and H∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y).
Proof. (i) If (G,ρ)∈\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F then G contains an r‑ball isomorphic to F at ρ, so π(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F)⊆U_F^Y. Conversely, if G∈U_F^Y via v, then (G,v)∈\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F and (G,v)∈π^{-1}(U_F^Y). Thus equality holds and π is open and surjective.
(ii) Fix D≥3 and let F be any rooted r‑ball containing a cycle. Construct G by starting from a rooted infinite tree T (degree ≤D) and, at distance N≫r from ρ, graft a finite connected graph H_0 which contains a copy of F (as the r‑ball around some vertex), ensuring no other vertex of G has an r‑ball isomorphic to F (e.g., make T and the rest cycle‑free, and keep H_0 finite). Then G∈U_F^Y. For any s<N, modify G outside B_s(G,ρ) by replacing H_0 with a tree of maximum degree ≤D to obtain H. Then B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) but H∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y), showing π^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open. ∎

Proposition 2 (One‑way transfer of nowhere denseness via openness).
If A⊆Y is nowhere dense in Y then π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. Let U be nonempty open in X. Then π(U) is nonempty open in Y. Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U′:=U∩π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and U′∩π^{-1}(A)=∅. Hence π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. ∎

Root‑free criterion for saturated sets
For an unrooted r‑ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B):=⋃_{v∈V(B)} \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}⊆X.

Proposition 3 (Root‑free characterization of nowhere denseness in X for saturated sets).
Let S⊆X be saturated (i.e., re‑rooting within the same unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r‑ball B there exists an unrooted r′‑ball B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S.
Proof. (⇒) If S is nowhere dense, every nonempty open set contains a smaller nonempty open set disjoint from S. Cyl(B) is a finite union of rooted cylinders, hence nonempty open whenever B occurs. Thus there is a rooted r′‑ball F′ with \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F′}⊂Cyl(B)\S. Let B′ be the underlying unrooted ball of F′; then Cyl(B′)=⋃_{w} \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{(B′,w)}⊂Cyl(B)\S by saturation of S.
(⇐) Conversely, let U be nonempty open in X; pick a rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F⊂U with underlying unrooted B. By hypothesis choose B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S. Then Cyl(B′) is a nonempty open subset of U disjoint from S. Hence S is nowhere dense. ∎

Odd‑D regular bridge forcing
Let D≥3 be odd. For a finite connected graph F, define S(F):=∑_{v∈V(F)}(D−deg_F(v))=D|V(F)|−2|E(F)|. In any D‑regular completion H⊇F, the number of edges crossing the cut δ_H(V(F)) equals S(F).

Theorem 4 (Odd‑D: forcing a unique crossing edge inside a ball).
Let D≥3 be odd and let F=B_r(G,ρ) be any rooted r‑ball that occurs in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r+1 and a rooted R‑ball F′ extending F with the properties:
(i) every vertex at distance <R from the root in F′ has degree D within F′;
(ii) S(F′)=1;
(iii) for any D‑regular graph G′ with B_R(G′,ρ)≅F′, the unique edge of δ_{G′}(V(B_R(G′,ρ))) is a (1‑way infinite) bridge.
Proof. Let L=L_r be the boundary of F and set c=∑_{v∈L}(D−deg_F(v))=S(F)≥1. Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1 and connect each v∈L to D−deg_F(v) distinct vertices of W (total c edges), thereby saturating all vertices of L to degree D in the augmented graph. Next add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t−c−1)/2. Choosing t≥c with t≡c+1 (mod 2) makes e_W an integer; take t large enough so a simple graph on W with degrees ≤D exists (greedy construction). Let F′ be the resulting R:=r+1 ball. Property (i) holds by construction and S(F′)=D t−(c+2e_W)=1, proving (ii). In any D‑regular completion, |δ(V(B_R))|=S(F′)=1, so the sole crossing edge is a bridge; as V(B_R) is finite, it is 1‑way infinite. ∎

Even‑D regular cut‑vertex forcing

Theorem 5 (Even‑D: forcing a cut vertex inside a ball).
Let D≥4 be even and let F=B_r(G,ρ) occur in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r and a rooted R‑ball F′ extending F with the properties:
(i) every vertex at distance <R other than the root ρ has degree D within F′;
(ii) deg_{F′}(ρ)=D−2;
(iii) for any D‑regular graph G′ with B_R(G′,ρ)≅F′, the root ρ is a cut vertex of G′.
Proof. Work inside the finite graph K_{D+2}. Delete a fixed perfect matching M to obtain a D‑regular connected graph R. Pick distinct vertices x,y,z with yz∈M (so yz∉E(R)). Delete edges xy and xz and add the edge yz. In the modified graph R*, deg(x)=D−2 and all other vertices have degree D; moreover R*−x is connected. Graft a copy of R* disjointly outside the boundary L_r of F and pin all adjacency within radius 1 of each vertex of R* so that, in F′, all vertices of distance <R other than ρ are saturated to degree D, while the root ρ has degree D−2 (route the attachment so that ρ plays the role of x). Then S(F′)=2 and any D‑regular completion must add exactly two cross edges, both incident to ρ, making ρ a cut vertex. ∎

Even‑D regular classification

Theorem 6 (Even‑D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).
Let D≥4 be even. In X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with the BS topology, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre.
Proof. In a D‑regular graph with even D, a 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component H with |δ(V(H))|=1. But for any finite induced subgraph H of a D‑regular graph G, |δ_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)| is even. Hence 1‑way infinite bridges cannot occur. By Theorem 16 (from the original note), graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Therefore “has a bridge” is meagre in X and its complement is comeagre. ∎

Eliminating bridges near the root (Theorem 16: ‘nowhere dense per k’)

Lemma 7 (Θ‑replacement forbids near‑root bridges).
Fix D>2 and k∈\mathbb{N}. For any rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F}⊆X, there exists a refined rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F′}⊂\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F} such that in every extension of F′ no edge at distance ≤k from the root is a bridge.
Proof. Let E_k be the set of edges of F whose endpoints lie at distance ≤k from the root. For each e=uv∈E_k, delete uv and insert a 2‑terminal, 2‑edge‑connected gadget Θ_e with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e–t_e paths (e.g., a θ‑graph with path lengths 2 and 3), and add edges u–s_e and v–t_e. This preserves deg(u),deg(v) and keeps all newly introduced degrees ≤3≤D. Perform these replacements for all e∈E_k using pairwise disjoint gadgets placed beyond the current radius as needed; let F′ be the resulting refined ball. In any completion, each replaced segment lies on a cycle within Θ_e, so no edge at distance ≤k from the root can be a bridge. ∎

Density of 2‑way infinite bridges in the ≤D space

Lemma 8 (≤D: density of 2‑way infinite bridge property).
Let D≥3. In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D}, the set of rooted graphs that admit a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof. Fix F=B_r(G,ρ). From a boundary vertex u at distance r, attach a simple path P of large length L using fresh vertices, keeping degrees ≤D (internal vertices of P have two path neighbors and at most D−2 new leaves if needed later). At the terminal x of P, create two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single new edge e so that deleting e separates the two infinite parts. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r so B_r remains F. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge and the resulting rooted graph lies in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F. ∎

Remarks.
- Proposition 2 provides a one‑way transfer of nowhere denseness from Y to X using only that π is open; the converse direction generally fails due to lack of continuity (Lemma 1(ii)).
- Propositions 3–5 supply root‑independent forcing mechanisms used in cylinder‑based and finite‑pinning topologies.
- Lemma 7 formalizes the ‘nowhere dense per k’ step in Theorem 16 while preserving degree constraints.

# Main Results



Main interim results toward the conjectures

- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):
  • Nowhere-dense part resolved. For any property P of unrooted graphs, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space iff the corresponding set T_P in the unrooted space is nowhere dense. This uses the forgetful map π (continuous, open, surjective) and yields a root-free cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets.
  • Meagre part resolved for all properties with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic P): S_P is meagre in the rooted space iff T_P is meagre in the unrooted space. Hence smallness is root-invariant for all natural properties considered (bridges, cut vertices, edge-colouring constraints, etc.).

- Metric sensitivity (Conjecture 2):
  • No-go: Any metric that induces the same cylinder (Benjamini–Schramm) topology preserves typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics.
  • Coarser “rootless-local” proximity: For a natural re-rooting–insensitive closeness, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, indicating genuinely different behavior once the topology is coarsened. The Baire status and typicality under such a topology remain open.


New classification in the even-regular case

- In the D-regular space with even D≥4 (Benjamini–Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs are comeagre: 1-way bridges are parity-forbidden, while 2-way bridges form a meagre set. Thus, bridgeless is typical in this regime.
