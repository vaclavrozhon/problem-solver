We'll use the root-free cylinder criterion for saturated sets to characterize nowhere-denseness. The one-way transfer from Y to X via \u03c0 open is valid, confirming that Conjecture 1 is resolved and noting the meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property while being cautious of continuity issues.",

A key correction revealed that the forgetful map \u03c0 is open and surjective but not continuous, so previous continuity arguments were revised. Conjecture 2 suggests that any metric with rooted cylinders preserves typicality without change. The explicit construction of gadgets was completed, including an odd-D parity gadget and an even-D gadget, leading to significant findings about bridgeless sets. We also proposed a new topology where one-way bridges are dense, leaving Baire status open. Citations will be included for reference.",
