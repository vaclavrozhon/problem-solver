{"summary_md":"Last round: Conjecture 1 (root‑invariance) was settled for nowhere‑denseness via a root‑free cylinder‑refinement criterion for saturated sets; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (e.g. Borel/analytic). A correction was made: the forgetful map π is open and surjective but not continuous for the “occurs‑somewhere” unrooted topology, so continuity‑based arguments were replaced by the cylinder test. Conjecture 2 admits a strong no‑go for any metric whose base is rooted cylinders (they induce the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved). We constructed explicit gadgets: an odd‑D parity refinement forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1‑way bridge in any D‑regular completion) and an even‑D refinement forcing a cut vertex; from this we deduced bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D for even D≥4. A coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) was proposed where 1‑way bridges are dense; its Baire/typicality remains open.
