Key corrections and consolidations this round:

1) Forgetful map π. Several drafts assumed π:X→Y is continuous for the unrooted “occurs‑somewhere” topology. That is false in general: preimages π^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in the rooted local topology because “occurs somewhere” does not constrain the root. Nonetheless, π is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders). Consequences: (i) Nowhere‑denseness transfers from Y to X using openness (A ND in Y ⇒ π^{-1}(A) ND in X); (ii) the converse and any meagreness equivalences cannot rely on π’s continuity. Use root‑free cylinder criteria on X for saturated sets instead. Please retract claims of full ND/meagre equivalence based solely on π’s continuity.

2) Conjecture 1 — ND part. The root‑free criterion for saturated sets S⊆X is correct and sufficient: S is ND iff every unrooted ball B admits a refinement B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S. This avoids π entirely and yields a genuinely root‑independent statement.

3) Conjecture 2 — local no‑go. The cylinder/finite‑lens (and any finer) topologies preserve all ND/meagre outcomes proved by cylinder refinements. The odd‑D bridge‑forcing (δ=1) gadget and the even‑D cut‑vertex forcing gadget are now correct; ensure radius‑1 pinning of all gadget vertices with degree D so no external edges can attach. Any metric equivalent to d_• (e.g., d_new mixes) cannot change typicality; please retract contrary claims.

4) Theorem 16 formalization. The “nowhere dense at distance ≤k” step is rigorous via 2‑terminal 2‑edge‑connected (Θ) replacements, preserving degrees (≤D) in both ≤D and =D spaces.

5) Even‑D classification. In =D with even D, 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges are meagre; hence bridgeless is comeagre. This positive typicality result should be recorded and is added to proofs/output.

Next steps: (i) Remove reliance on π‑continuity: replace with (a) π open one‑way ND transfer, and (b) the root‑free ND criterion; (ii) keep odd‑D δ=1 and even‑D cut‑vertex gadgets fully pinned; (iii) analyze Baire status and category under genuinely coarser topologies (occurrence/tail); (iv) if aiming at meagreness transfer, use Banach–Mazur game on saturated cylinders within X rather than π.
