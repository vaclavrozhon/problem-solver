  "feedback_md": "Key corrections and consolidations this round:\n\n1) Forgetful map \u03c0. Several drafts assumed \u03c0:X\u2192Y is continuous for the unrooted \u201coccurs\u2011somewhere\u201d topology. That is false in general: preimages \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in the rooted local topology because \u201coccurs somewhere\u201d does not constrain the root. Nonetheless, \u03c0 is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders). Consequences: (i) Nowhere\u2011denseness transfers from Y to X using openness (A ND in Y \u21d2 \u03c0^{-1}(A) ND in X); (ii) the converse and any meagreness equivalences cannot rely on \u03c0\u2019s continuity. Use root\u2011free cylinder criteria on X for saturated sets instead. Please retract claims of full ND/meagre equivalence based solely on \u03c0\u2019s continuity.\n\n2) Conjecture 1 \u2014 ND part. The root\u2011free criterion for saturated sets S\u2286X is correct and sufficient: S is ND iff every unrooted ball B admits a refinement B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\S. This avoids \u03c0 entirely and yields a genuinely root\u2011independent statement.\n\n3) Conjecture 2 \u2014 local no\u2011go. The cylinder/finite\u2011lens (and any finer) topologies preserve all ND/meagre outcomes proved by cylinder refinements. The odd\u2011D bridge\u2011forcing (\u03b4=1) gadget and the even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex forcing gadget are now correct; ensure radius\u20111 pinning of all gadget vertices with degree D so no external edges can attach. Any metric equivalent to d_\u2022 (e.g., d_new mixes) cannot change typicality; please retract contrary claims.\n\n4) Theorem 16 formalization. The \u201cnowhere dense at distance \u2264k\u201d step is rigorous via 2\u2011terminal 2\u2011edge\u2011connected (\u0398) replacements, preserving degrees (\u2264D) in both \u2264D and =D spaces.\n\n5) Even\u2011D classification. In =D with even D, 1\u2011way bridges are parity\u2011forbidden; 2\u2011way bridges are meagre; hence bridgeless is comeagre. This positive typicality result should be recorded and is added to proofs/output.\n\nNext steps: (i) Remove reliance on \u03c0\u2011continuity: replace with (a) \u03c0 open one\u2011way ND transfer, and (b) the root\u2011free ND criterion; (ii) keep odd\u2011D \u03b4=1 and even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex gadgets fully pinned; (iii) analyze Baire status and category under genuinely coarser topologies (occurrence/tail); (iv) if aiming at meagreness transfer, use Banach\u2013Mazur game on saturated cylinders within X rather than \u03c0.\n",

We adopt a root\u2011free cylinder criterion for ND of saturated sets, which settles Conjecture 1 (ND part) rigorously. For Conjecture 2, cylinder/finite\u2011lens topologies cannot change typicality; the odd\u2011D bridge\u2011forcing and even\u2011D cut\u2011vertex gadgets are now clean. We formalized the distance\u2011k exclusion for Theorem 16 via \u0398\u2011replacements. New: in =D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre (parity + Theorem 16).

The forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (rooted\u2192unrooted) is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders), but not continuous for the rootless \u201coccurs\u2011somewhere\u201d topology in general. Thus ND/meagreness equivalences cannot rely on \u03c0\u2019s continuity.\n\n- Root\u2011free ND criterion (Conjecture 1, ND part). For saturated S\u2286X, S is nowhere dense iff for every unrooted r\u2011ball B there exists B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\S. This gives a root\u2011independent test and replaces \u03c0\u2011based continuity arguments.\n\n- Odd\u2011D regular forcing (bridge). Using a counting layer W, choose t and e_W so all interior vertices are saturated to degree D and S(F\u2032)=1. Any D\u2011regular completion adds exactly one cross edge, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\n\n- Even\u2011D regular forcing (cut vertex). Pin a finite gadget so all vertices except u have degree D in the refined ball, while deg(u)=D\u22122. Any D\u2011regular completion attaches both cross edges at u, making u a cut vertex.\n\n- Theorem 16 (distance\u2011k exclusion). Replace each edge within distance \u2264k by a 2\u2011terminal 2\u2011edge\u2011connected \u0398\u2011gadget (preserving endpoint degrees). This forbids bridges within radius k in any extension, proving the \u2018nowhere dense per k\u2019 step.\n\n- Even\u2011D regular classification. In =D with even D, 1\u2011way bridges are parity\u2011forbidden; graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge are meagre; hence bridgeless graphs are comeagre.\n\n- Coarser topologies. Root\u2011insensitive/occurrence/tail topologies exhibit density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any topology still containing rooted cylinders (or finite pinning) as opens preserves current typicality (no bridgeless\u2011typical in \u2264D, odd D)."

(i) If (G,\u03c1)\u2208\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F then G contains an r\u2011ball isomorphic to F at \u03c1, so \u03c0(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F)\u2286U_F^Y. Conversely, if G\u2208U_F^Y via v, then (G,v)\u2208\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F and (G,v)\u2208\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y). Thus equality holds and \u03c0 is open and surjective.\n(ii) Fix D\u22653 and let F be any rooted r\u2011ball containing a cycle. Construct G by starting from a rooted infinite tree T (degree \u2264D) and, at distance N\u226br from \u03c1, graft a finite connected graph H_0 which contains a copy of F (as the r\u2011ball around some vertex), ensuring no other vertex of G has an r\u2011ball isomorphic to F (e.g., make T and the rest cycle\u2011free, and keep H_0 finite). Then G\u2208U_F^Y. For any s<N, modify G outside B_s(G,\u03c1) by replacing H_0 with a tree of maximum degree \u2264D to obtain H. Then B_s(H,\u03c1)=B_s(G,\u03c1) but H\u2209\u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y), showing \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open. \u220e\n\nProposition 2 (One\u2011way transfer of nowhere denseness via openness).\nIf A\u2286Y is nowhere dense in Y then \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. Let U be nonempty open in X. Then \u03c0(U) is nonempty open in Y. Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V\u2286\u03c0(U) with V\u2229A=\u2205. Then U\u2032:=U\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and U\u2032\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u2205. Hence \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nRoot\u2011free criterion for saturated sets\nFor an unrooted r\u2011ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B):=\u22c3_{v\u2208V(B)} \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{(B,v)}\u2286X.\n\nProposition 3 (Root\u2011free characterization of nowhere denseness in X for saturated sets).\nLet S\u2286X be saturated (i.e., re\u2011rooting within the same unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r\u2011ball B there exists an unrooted r\u2032\u2011ball B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\S.\nProof. (\u21d2) If S is nowhere dense, every nonempty open set contains a smaller nonempty open set disjoint from S. Cyl(B) is a finite union of rooted cylinders, hence nonempty open whenever B occurs. Thus there is a rooted r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2282Cyl(B)\\S. Let B\u2032 be the underlying unrooted ball of F\u2032; then Cyl(B\u2032)=\u22c3_{w} \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{(B\u2032,w)}\u2282Cyl(B)\\S by saturation of S.\n(\u21d0) Conversely, let U be nonempty open in X; pick a rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F\u2282U with underlying unrooted B. By hypothesis choose B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\S. Then Cyl(B\u2032) is a nonempty open subset of U disjoint from S. Hence S is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nOdd\u2011D regular bridge forcing\nLet D\u22653 be odd. For a finite connected graph F, define S(F):=\u2211_{v\u2208V(F)}(D\u2212deg_F(v))=D|V(F)|\u22122|E(F)|. In any D\u2011regular completion H\u2287F, the number of edges crossing the cut \u03b4_H(V(F)) equals S(F).\n\nTheorem 4 (Odd\u2011D: forcing a unique crossing edge inside a ball).\nLet D\u22653 be odd and let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) be any rooted r\u2011ball that occurs in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exist R\u2265r+1 and a rooted R\u2011ball F\u2032 extending F with the properties:\n(i) every vertex at distance <R from the root in F\u2032 has degree D within F\u2032;\n(ii) S(F\u2032)=1;\n(iii) for any D\u2011regular graph G\u2032 with B_R(G\u2032,\u03c1)\u2245F\u2032, the unique edge of \u03b4_{G\u2032}(V(B_R(G\u2032,\u03c1))) is a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge.\nProof. Let L=L_r be the boundary of F and set c=\u2211_{v\u2208L}(D\u2212deg_F(v))=S(F)\u22651. Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1 and connect each v\u2208L to D\u2212deg_F(v) distinct vertices of W (total c edges), thereby saturating all vertices of L to degree D in the augmented graph. Next add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t\u2212c\u22121)/2. Choosing t\u2265c with t\u2261c+1 (mod 2) makes e_W an integer; take t large enough so a simple graph on W with degrees \u2264D exists (greedy construction). Let F\u2032 be the resulting R:=r+1 ball. Property (i) holds by construction and S(F\u2032)=D t\u2212(c+2e_W)=1, proving (ii). In any D\u2011regular completion, |\u03b4(V(B_R))|=S(F\u2032)=1, so the sole crossing edge is a bridge; as V(B_R) is finite, it is 1\u2011way infinite. \u220e\n\nEven\u2011D regular cut\u2011vertex forcing\n\nTheorem 5 (Even\u2011D: forcing a cut vertex inside a ball).\nLet D\u22654 be even and let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) occur in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exist R\u2265r and a rooted R\u2011ball F\u2032 extending F with the properties:\n(i) every vertex at distance <R other than the root \u03c1 has degree D within F\u2032;\n(ii) deg_{F\u2032}(\u03c1)=D\u22122;\n(iii) for any D\u2011regular graph G\u2032 with B_R(G\u2032,\u03c1)\u2245F\u2032, the root \u03c1 is a cut vertex of G\u2032.\nProof. Work inside the finite graph K_{D+2}. Delete a fixed perfect matching M to obtain a D\u2011regular connected graph R. Pick distinct vertices x,y,z with yz\u2208M (so yz\u2209E(R)). Delete edges xy and xz and add the edge yz. In the modified graph R*, deg(x)=D\u22122 and all other vertices have degree D; moreover R*\u2212x is connected. Graft a copy of R* disjointly outside the boundary L_r of F and pin all adjacency within radius 1 of each vertex of R* so that, in F\u2032, all vertices of distance <R other than \u03c1 are saturated to degree D, while the root \u03c1 has degree D\u22122 (route the attachment so that \u03c1 plays the role of x). Then S(F\u2032)=2 and any D\u2011regular completion must add exactly two cross edges, both incident to \u03c1, making \u03c1 a cut vertex. \u220e\n\nEven\u2011D regular classification\n\nTheorem 6 (Even\u2011D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).\nLet D\u22654 be even. In X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with the BS topology, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre.\nProof. In a D\u2011regular graph with even D, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component H with |\u03b4(V(H))|=1. But for any finite induced subgraph H of a D\u2011regular graph G, |\u03b4_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|\u22122|E(H)| is even. Hence 1\u2011way infinite bridges cannot occur. By Theorem 16 (from the original note), graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Therefore \u201chas a bridge\u201d is meagre in X and its complement is comeagre. \u220e\n\nEliminating bridges near the root (Theorem 16: \u2018nowhere dense per k\u2019)\n\nLemma 7 (\u0398\u2011replacement forbids near\u2011root bridges).\nFix D>2 and k\u2208\\mathbb{N}. For any rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F}\u2286X, there exists a refined rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2282\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F} such that in every extension of F\u2032 no edge at distance \u2264k from the root is a bridge.\nProof. Let E_k be the set of edges of F whose endpoints lie at distance \u2264k from the root. For each e=uv\u2208E_k, delete uv and insert a 2\u2011terminal, 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadget \u0398_e with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e\u2013t_e paths (e.g., a \u03b8\u2011graph with path lengths 2 and 3), and add edges u\u2013s_e and v\u2013t_e. This preserves deg(u),deg(v) and keeps all newly introduced degrees \u22643\u2264D. Perform these replacements for all e\u2208E_k using pairwise disjoint gadgets placed beyond the current radius as needed; let F\u2032 be the resulting refined ball. In any completion, each replaced segment lies on a cycle within \u0398_e, so no edge at distance \u2264k from the root can be a bridge. \u220e\n\nDensity of 2\u2011way infinite bridges in the \u2264D space\n\nLemma 8 (\u2264D: density of 2\u2011way infinite bridge property).\nLet D\u22653. In \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\u2264D}, the set of rooted graphs that admit a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense.\nProof. Fix F=B_r(G,\u03c1). From a boundary vertex u at distance r, attach a simple path P of large length L using fresh vertices, keeping degrees \u2264D (internal vertices of P have two path neighbors and at most D\u22122 new leaves if needed later). At the terminal x of P, create two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single new edge e so that deleting e separates the two infinite parts. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r so B_r remains F. Then e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge and the resulting rooted graph lies in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F. \u220e\n\nRemarks.\n- Proposition 2 provides a one\u2011way transfer of nowhere denseness from Y to X using only that \u03c0 is open; the converse direction generally fails due to lack of continuity (Lemma 1(ii)).\n- Propositions 3\u20135 supply root\u2011independent forcing mechanisms used in cylinder\u2011based and finite\u2011pinning topologies.\n- Lemma 7 formalizes the \u2018nowhere dense per k\u2019 step in Theorem 16 while preserving degree constraints.\n"
