# Open Problem: Resolve the Final Two Conjectures on Typical Properties of Countable Graphs

This note poses two conjectures extracted from the extended abstract **“Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges (extended abstract)”** by Robert Šámal and Hadi Zamani (EUROCOMB’25). We first state the setting precisely and then formulate the conjectures. The authors’ extended abstract (lightly re‑typeset) follows afterward for context.

---

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

---

## Conjectures

### Conjecture 1 — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

### Conjecture 2 — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

---

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

---

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

---

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.

# Research Notes



Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2

1) Root-invariance (Conjecture 1)
- Spaces: X = G_{\bullet,D} (rooted local topology), Y = unrooted countable connected graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v with B_r(G,v) ≅ F}.
- Forgetful map π: X → Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open, surjective.
- Consequences:
  • Nowhere denseness transfers: A⊆Y is nowhere dense ⇔ π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
  • Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic): A meagre in Y ⇔ π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
  • Hence for any natural property P of unrooted graphs (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.), the smallness/meagreness status of S_P in X is root-invariant.
- Alternative restatement (root-free ND test): For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense ⇔ for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}.
- Caution: Saturating a nowhere dense set need not remain nowhere dense (can become dense meagre). Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.

2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2
- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.
- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.

3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2
- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.
- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.

4) Section metrics on unrooted space
- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show ‘bridgeless’ remains nowhere dense for every section metric.

5) Action items
- Move π-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.
- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.
- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.
- For ‘2-way infinite bridge’ across section metrics, fill in the ‘not nowhere dense’ part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.


Addendum — Odd-D regular bridge gadget and coarser topologies

- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r′-ball F′ with S(F′)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.
- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.


Update — Root-invariance finalized; even-D cut-vertex forcing

- Conjecture 1: We adopt the forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted). π is continuous, open, surjective. For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. For sets A with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. Thus smallness/meagreness of S_P is root-invariant for all natural properties considered. Note: without the Baire property, meagreness transfer need not hold; we avoid such claims.

- Odd D-regular (bridge forcing): We keep the δ(F′)=1 parity construction: extend an r-ball F by one layer W, choose t and e_W so that every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1. Then any D-regular completion has exactly one cross edge—a 1-way infinite bridge.

- Even D-regular (cut vertex forcing): We can refine any cylinder to pin a finite gadget so that all vertices except a designated vertex u have degree D within the refined ball, while deg(u)=D−2. Consequently, in any D-regular completion all cross edges attach to u, making u a cut vertex. One explicit seed: start from K_{D,D}, pick x∈A, y1,y2∈B, delete x−y1 and x−y2, add y1−y2; pin radius-1 neighborhoods. Embedding this seed outward in the ball yields the desired refinement.

- Coarser topologies: For root-insensitive topologies (e.g., d_any/occurrence), graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; bridgeless graphs often are too (proved for D≥4 in Y). Baire/Polish status of these topologies remains the key open point to conclude typicality there.

New observations and clarifications

- Conjecture 1: Using the forgetful map π (rooted→unrooted), we have exact transfer of nowhere‑denseness and, for sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), meagreness. Thus smallness/typicality for natural unrooted properties is root‑invariant. Caution: without the Baire property meagreness need not transfer.

- Odd‑D regular: The δ=1 parity gadget is confirmed. From any r‑ball F, add one layer W and choose internal edges so every vertex at distance <R is saturated to degree D and S(F′)=1; any D‑regular completion has a unique crossing edge, hence a 1‑way infinite bridge.

- Even‑D regular: A finite refinement can concentrate all boundary deficit at the root (deg D−2) while saturating all other vertices to D. In any D‑regular completion both cross edges attach to the root, making it a cut vertex. Additionally, bridgeless graphs are comeagre in =D with even D: 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges form a meagre set; hence the complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

- Coarser topologies: Root‑insensitive/occurrence/tail ideas show density phenomena, but Baire/Polish status remains open. Any metric/topology still containing rooted cylinders as opens (or finite‑pinning) preserves the current typicality; no such topology can make bridgeless typical in ≤D or in =D with odd D.

- Metric caution: Adding an occurrence term to d_• (e.g., d_new = d_C∘Φ + ε d_•) does not change the topology; typicality and nowhere‑denseness remain unchanged under such metrics.

# Main Results



Main interim results toward the conjectures

- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):
  • Nowhere-dense part resolved. For any property P of unrooted graphs, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space iff the corresponding set T_P in the unrooted space is nowhere dense. This uses the forgetful map π (continuous, open, surjective) and yields a root-free cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets.
  • Meagre part resolved for all properties with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic P): S_P is meagre in the rooted space iff T_P is meagre in the unrooted space. Hence smallness is root-invariant for all natural properties considered (bridges, cut vertices, edge-colouring constraints, etc.).

- Metric sensitivity (Conjecture 2):
  • No-go: Any metric that induces the same cylinder (Benjamini–Schramm) topology preserves typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics.
  • Coarser “rootless-local” proximity: For a natural re-rooting–insensitive closeness, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, indicating genuinely different behavior once the topology is coarsened. The Baire status and typicality under such a topology remain open.


New classification in the even-regular case

- In the D-regular space with even D≥4 (Benjamini–Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs are comeagre: 1-way bridges are parity-forbidden, while 2-way bridges form a meagre set. Thus, bridgeless is typical in this regime.


=== Prover 1 Output ===

New contributions, corrections, and rigor upgrades

1) Correction: the forgetful map π is not continuous for the “rootless-local” topology on unrooted graphs

Let X=G_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) topology (cylinder base G_\bullet^F). Let Y be the unrooted space equipped with the “rootless-local” topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v with B_r(G,v)≅F}.
- π:X→Y is surjective and open (π(G_\bullet^F)=U_F^Y), but in general not continuous: π^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in X. Indeed, fix D≥3, a rooted r-ball F containing a cycle. Let (G,ρ) be any rooted graph whose underlying graph contains exactly one occurrence of F, sitting beyond distance N from ρ. For any s<N, every (H,ρ) with B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) can be obtained by modifying G outside B_s(G,ρ). Modifying G beyond radius s to destroy the unique F (replace the far region by a tree) yields (H,ρ)∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y), yet arbitrarily close to (G,ρ). Thus π^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open; hence π is not continuous. 
- Takeaway: arguments for Conjecture 1 should avoid continuity of π. The nowhere-dense part can be handled within X via saturated-cylinder refinements (root-free formulation below). For meagreness, restrict to Baire‑property sets and use game/topological arguments internal to X.

2) Root‑free criterion for nowhere denseness (safe resolution of Conjecture 1, ND part)

Let S⊂X be saturated (i.e., depends only on the unrooted graph). For an unrooted r-ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_\bullet^{(B,v)}.
Proposition 2.1. S is nowhere dense in X iff for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S.
Proof. This is a root‑free restatement of the standard cylinder‑refinement criterion: cylinders form a base, and saturated unions across all rootings of B are finite unions of cylinders. The usual “nowhere dense iff each nonempty basic open contains a smaller basic open disjoint from S” translates verbatim to the unrooted formulation via Cyl(B).

3) Even‑D regular case: bridgeless is comeagre (a complete, concise proof)

Theorem 3.1. In X=G_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4, the set Br of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
Proof. In an infinite connected graph, every bridge is either 1‑way infinite or 2‑way infinite. In D‑regular graphs with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges are parity‑forbidden (each finite cut has even size), hence cannot occur. By Theorem 16, the set T_{2wb} of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in X. Therefore X\Br = T_{2wb} is meagre, so Br is comeagre in the Baire space X.

4) Canonical, degree‑respecting gadgets (now fully explicit)

4.1 Odd D (D≥3): unique external edge forcing
For a finite connected F, S(F)=∑_{v}(D−deg_F(v)). In any D‑regular completion H⊇F, |δ_H(V(F))|=S(F). For odd D and any rooted r‑ball F that occurs in some D‑regular graph, we produce an r′‑ball F′ with S(F′)=1:
- Let L be the boundary of F, c=∑_{v∈L}(D−deg_F(v)). Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1; connect each v∈L to D−deg_F(v) distinct vertices in W (total c edges). Add e_W internal edges in W so that e_W=(D t−c−1)/2; choose t≥c with t≡c+1 (mod 2) so e_W∈\mathbb{N} and degrees in W ≤ D. Then S(F′)=Dt−(c+2e_W)=1. 
- All vertices within distance ≤r are saturated to degree D in F′, so F′ is an (r+1)-ball. In any D‑regular completion, exactly one edge leaves V(F′), necessarily a (1‑way infinite) bridge.

4.2 Even D (D≥4): cut‑vertex forcing
We build a finite D‑bounded refinement with a designated u of degree D−2; all other vertices in the r′‑ball have degree D.
- Inside K_{D+2}, delete a fixed perfect matching to obtain a D‑regular connected R. Pick x and y,z so that yz belongs to the deleted matching. Remove xy and xz, add yz; denote u:=x. Then deg_R(u)=D−2; all other vertices have degree D, and R−u is connected. Graft R far beyond the original boundary and saturate all vertices within radius to form an r′‑ball F′. 
- In any D‑regular completion, exactly two external edges must be added (S(F′)=2), both incident to u. Removing u disconnects the graph; hence u is a cut vertex.

5) Local exclusion for 2‑way bridges near the root (formalizing Theorem 16’s “nowhere dense” step)

Fix k∈\mathbb{N}. Let A_k be the set of rooted graphs in X with a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root. We show A_k is nowhere dense via 2‑terminal replacements.
Lemma 5.1. For any cylinder G_\bullet^F and k, there is a refinement cylinder G_\bullet^{F′}⊂G_\bullet^F such that no extension of F′ contains a bridge at distance ≤k.
Proof. Let E_k be edges of F with both endpoints at distance ≤k from the root. For each e=uv∈E_k, replace e within F by a 2‑terminal, 2‑edge‑connected gadget Θ_e: delete uv; insert a gadget with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e–t_e paths (e.g., a θ‑graph of lengths 2 and 3); connect u–s_e and v–t_e by single edges. This preserves deg(u),deg(v); all internal degrees are ≤3≤D (since D>2). Do this disjointly for all e∈E_k, placing gadgets within an expanded radius r′. In any extension, all edges within distance ≤k are contained in cycles (inside Θ_e), and hence are not bridges. Therefore the refined cylinder avoids A_k. Thus A_k is nowhere dense, and ⋃_k A_k (graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge) is meagre.

6) Strengthened no‑go: finite‑lens (FLP) topologies cannot change typicality

Definition 6.1 (FLP opens). An FLP open set is specified by finitely many designated vertices v_1,…,v_m and radii r_1,…,r_m together with isomorphism types of the rooted balls around them, without imposing constraints elsewhere.
Observation 6.2. Every FLP open set is a finite union of intersections of standard cylinders, hence the FLP topology equals the BS topology. Consequently, Theorems 14–17, the even‑D comeagreness of bridgeless graphs, and all “cylinder‑refinement” arguments persist under any FLP metric.

7) Root‑insensitive pseudometric d_any: density upgrades

Define on X: for x=(G,ρ), y=(H,σ), let δ(x,y)=2^{−sup{ r: ∃σ′ B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ′) }} and d_any(x,y)=max{δ(x,y),δ(y,x)}. Two graphs are close if each one’s rooted balls appear somewhere in the other.
- 1‑way bridges dense (≤D): given (G,ρ) and r, take F=B_r(G,ρ), attach beyond radius r a pendant infinite ray by a single edge at a boundary vertex with available degree, and complete the remainder at distance ≥ r+1. Then d_any≤2^{−r}.
- 2‑way bridges dense (≤D): attach beyond radius r two disjoint infinite bounded‑degree structures S_1,S_2 and then a single edge e between them; ensure connectivity to the copy of F occurs outside radius r; e is a 2‑way infinite bridge.
- Bridgeless dense (≤D): graft the copy of F to a 2‑edge‑connected infinite scaffold S (e.g., an infinite ladder for D≥3; for general D use a 2‑edge‑connected bounded‑degree graph) by connecting boundary vertices into S along edge‑disjoint paths so that each crossing edge lies on a cycle. Then H is bridgeless and d_any≤2^{−r}.
Remark. Under d_any, all three classes (bridgeless, 1‑way, and 2‑way bridgeful) are dense. Typicality thus hinges on whether the d_any‑quotient is Baire; we leave this open.

8) Ideas, obstacles, and next steps

- Ideas: Use the root‑free cylinder criterion (2.1) as the canonical tool for Conjecture 1 (ND part). For meagreness, employ the Banach–Mazur game on cylinders: S is meagre iff Player II can avoid S. Design root‑free strategies for saturated S (bridges, cut vertices, χ′=D+1) to obtain explicit, root‑invariant proofs.
- Examples: The Θ‑replacement in Lemma 5.1 prevents bridges within bounded distance uniformly in both ≤D and =D settings; the odd‑D gadget C1 and even‑D gadget D1 are fully explicit and degree‑respecting.
- Obstacles: The earlier “π is continuous and open” claim for the rootless topology is false; hence meagreness transfer must avoid that route. For d_any, we lack a proof of Baire‑ness (or even of metric completeness on the quotient); typicality statements there remain conditional.
- Next steps: (i) Add full proofs of Lemmas/Propositions 2.1, 5.1 and Theorem 3.1 to proofs.md. (ii) Formalize the Banach–Mazur game for saturated sets; verify meagreness of T_{2wb} via a root‑free II‑strategy. (iii) For Conjecture 2, choose a specific root‑insensitive topology (e.g., occurrence pattern on Y) and determine its Baire status; then classify bridges’ category there. (iv) Record FLP no‑go (6.2) in proofs.md to delimit “natural alternative metrics” that cannot alter typicality.

Corrections

- The earlier metric d_new(x,y)=d_C(Occ∘π(x),Occ∘π(y))+ε d_•(x,y) is topologically equivalent to d_• because Occ∘π is continuous in d_•. Hence typicality/nowhere‑denseness do not change under d_new. Any claim to the contrary is retracted.

Root–unrooted transfer and Baire property

- Lemma 1 (π continuous, open, surjective). For the forgetful map π:X→Y, π^{-1}(U_Y(F))=𝔾_{•}^F and π(𝔾_{•}^F)=U_Y(F), so π is continuous and open; surjectivity is trivial.
- Lemma 2 (Baire). X is compact metric (diagonal extraction on rooted balls). Y is Baire as a continuous open image of the Baire space X.
- Proposition 3 (Nowhere‑dense transfer). For A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X. Proof: openness/continuity of π transfer interior of closures in both directions.
- Proposition 4 (Meagreness for BP sets). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) meagre in X. Proof: pullback/“open symmetric difference” argument; X is Baire.

Even‑D regular: bridgeless is comeagre

- Theorem 5. In 𝔾_{•,=D} for even D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
  Proof. A 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component S with |δ(S)|=1. In a D‑regular graph, D|S|=2|E(S)|+|δ(S)|; the left side is even and 2|E(S)| is even, so |δ(S)| is even. Hence 1‑way bridges are impossible. Therefore “has a bridge” = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge”. By Theorem 16, the latter is meagre; its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Odd‑D regular: bridge forcing gadget (cleaned)

- Notation. For a finite connected rooted subgraph H (intended to be the refined ball), define S(H)=∑_{v∈V(H)}(D−deg_H(v)). In any D‑regular extension, |δ(V(H))|=S(H). For odd D, S(H)≡|V(H)| (mod 2).
- Gadgets.
  • Port creation: For a boundary vertex x, attach D−deg_H(x) disjoint paths x–a–b and saturate a,b to degree D using only new vertices outward. S(H) unchanged; deficit moves to ports b at larger radius.
  • Pair closure: Given two ports b_i,b_j, embed them as the two degree‑(D−1) vertices of a copy of K_{D+1}−e placed outward; add the missing edge inside the gadget. This reduces S by 2 and saturates all new vertices to degree D.
  • Parity flipper (odd D): Add a vertex z adjacent to two boundary vertices and saturate z outward to degree D; ΔS=D−4 is odd.
- Lemma 6 (Reduction to S=1 while preserving ball structure). From any rooted r‑ball F in an odd‑D regular graph, by outward‑only applications of the above gadgets one obtains a finite connected H⊇F with S(H)=1 such that no new edges join interior vertices and all interior vertices (distance ≤ current boundary) have degree D. Thus H is the rooted r′‑ball (for some r′>r) in any D‑regular extension.
  Sketch. If S(F) even, flip parity once. Port‑create at all boundary vertices until they are saturated; while S>1, pair‑close two ports at a time. All new edges are incident to outward vertices only; degrees of interior vertices are D, so no further edges to the outside appear in any extension. Hence H is a ball; and |δ(V(H))|=1 in any extension.
- Proposition 7 (Odd‑D bridge forcing). For odd D>2, every cylinder 𝔾_{•}^F has a refinement 𝔾_{•}^{F′} such that every D‑regular extension of F′ contains a bridge. Proof: Take H from Lemma 6; the unique cross edge is a bridge.

Bounded re‑rooting invariance for section metrics

- Lemma 8. If sections s,t on Y satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤N for all G, then Id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. Proof: If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))≅B_{r+N}(H,s(H)); moving roots by ≤N yields B_r(G,t(G))≅B_r(H,t(H)). Symmetric argument gives the inverse.

Density phenomena in the unrooted occurrence (rootless local) topology

- Lemma 9 (Density of 1‑way bridges in Y). Given finitely many required rooted occurrences and forbiddances within radius R, there exists G with Δ≤D containing the required patterns, avoiding the forbidden ones, and having a 1‑way infinite bridge (attach a pendant infinite 2‑edge‑connected block by a single edge to a finite core realizing the constraints, using high girth to avoid forbidden patterns).
- Lemma 10 (Density of bridgeless graphs in Y). Under the same finite constraints, there exists an infinite bridgeless G with Δ≤D realizing them (attach a high‑girth infinite 2‑edge‑connected backbone and connect the core by two edge‑disjoint paths).
- Comment. By π‑transfer, these density statements lift to the rooted space X. They do not contradict Theorem 14: a set can be dense and nowhere dense simultaneously.

No‑go for cylinder‑based metric changes

- Proposition 11. Any metric on X whose open sets are unions of rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_•; hence nowhere‑denseness and meagreness (Baire‑property sets) are unchanged. In particular, mixing any continuous “occurrence” term with d_• (as in the retracted d_new) preserves typicality.

Examples

- Parity check (odd D): For D=3 and a tree H on m vertices, S(H)=3m−2(m−1)=m+2 (odd ⇔ m odd), validating the need for a parity flip when necessary.
- Even D comeagre: In 4‑regular graphs, 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre; thus bridgeless is typical.

Obstacles

- Even‑D cut‑vertex forcing (sketch provided previously) still requires a full layer‑respecting degree bookkeeping write‑up.
- The ball‑preservation detail in Lemma 6 (H is indeed a rooted ball in all extensions) needs a short formal argument using “interior vertices saturated to degree D” and outward‑only attachments.

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Propositions 3–4 to proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 rigorously.
- Write a complete proof of Lemma 6 and Proposition 7 with explicit radii and disjointness of gadgets; add the even‑D cut‑vertex forcing lemma fully.
- Record Theorem 5 (even D regular: bridgeless comeagre) in output.md and proofs.md.
- For Conjecture 2, focus on genuinely non‑cylinder topologies (e.g., tail/complement topologies). Establish Baire/non‑Baire status and then determine the category of bridgeful/bridgeless sets there. Avoid cylinder‑based mixes like the retracted d_new.


=== Prover 3 Output ===

Ideas
- Consolidate Conjecture 1 by adding a short proof that the unrooted space Y (rootless local topology) is Baire via the forgetful map π:X→Y. This lets us pull typicality statements between X and Y for saturated properties.
- Close the gap “D=3 bridgeless dense in Y”: give a constructive, degree‑bounded, 2‑edge‑connected completion procedure that, starting from any valid finite r‑ball F, builds an infinite bridgeless graph of maximum degree ≤ D (D≥3) containing an occurrence of F. This removes a previous open point and strengthens the coarser‑topology analysis.
- Record a simple parity+Theorem 16 proof that in =D with even D, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under d_• (and in Y), complementing the odd‑D no‑go.
- Extract a general no‑go principle: on any Baire topology on X in which rooted cylinders are open, bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre in ≤D (and in =D for odd D) because “has a (1‑way) bridge” contains a nonempty open cylinder.

Baire property of the unrooted space
Lemma 1. Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the rooted local topology and Y the unrooted degree‑bounded space with the rootless local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. Then Y is a Baire space.
Proof. The forgetful map π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open and surjective (preimage/image of a cylinder is a cylinder). Let (U_n)_n be dense open in Y. Then π^{-1}(U_n) are dense open in X, hence ⋂_n π^{-1}(U_n) is dense in X. For any nonempty open W⊆Y, π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X and intersects ⋂_n π^{-1}(U_n). Applying π (which is open), we get W∩⋂_n U_n≠∅. ∎

Even‑regular typicality
Lemma 2 (Cut‑size parity for finite subgraphs). If H is a finite induced subgraph of a D‑regular graph G, then |δ_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)| is even.
Proof. Sum degrees in G over V(H): D|V(H)|=2|E(H)|+|δ_G(V(H))|. ∎
Theorem 3. In X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4 (and likewise in Y), the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre under the standard topology.
Proof. Theorem 16 gives that graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge form a meagre set in X; by Corollary 3 (meagreness transfer for Baire‑property sets via π), the same holds in Y. In even‑regular graphs, 1‑way infinite bridges are parity‑forbidden by Lemma 2 (applied to the finite component). Hence “has a bridge” is meagre, and its complement “bridgeless” is comeagre. ∎

Degree‑completion tool
Lemma 4 (Degree completion to an infinite D‑bounded supergraph). Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree ≤ D and D≥3. Then there exists a connected infinite supergraph G⊇H with max degree ≤ D such that no new edges are added between vertices of H.
Proof (sketch). Build an infinite 2‑edge‑connected “backbone” R of maximum degree ≤3 (e.g., the infinite ladder; to keep degrees ≤3 upon attachments, first subdivide every edge of the ladder once, producing many degree‑2 vertices). Enumerate the boundary “stubs” of H: the multiset S={ (v,i): 1≤i≤D−deg_H(v) }. For each s∈S, attach a new path of length ≥1 from v to a distinct degree‑2 vertex of the subdivided ladder, using fresh vertices; this raises v’s degree by 1 and that ladder vertex’s degree to 3, keeping degrees ≤D. Do this so the attachments are disjoint outside H; the result is connected and infinite, with max degree ≤D, and no new H–H edges. ∎

Bridgeless density in Y for D≥3
Proposition 5. Fix D≥3. In the unrooted space Y with max degree ≤D, the set of bridgeless graphs is dense.
Proof. Let U_F^Y be a nonempty basic open set, where F is a valid rooted r‑ball (i.e., occurs somewhere in Y). Start with a copy of H:=F as a rooted subgraph; let L_r be its boundary. If |L_r|<2, extend outward by one or two layers (adding new vertices only outside L_r) until the new outer boundary has at least two vertices; denote the resulting ball still by H (this does not affect membership in U_F^Y since B_r remains F). Use Lemma 4 to build an infinite connected supergraph G_1⊇H with max degree ≤D, adding no H–H edges.
Next, prepare two external interfaces: choose two distinct boundary vertices s,t∈L_r (possible by the adjustment above). By Lemma 4’s construction, s and t each received at least one new edge to the outside; let s',t' be the first new neighbours of s,t outside H. In the attached backbone (the subdivided ladder R), there is a simple path Q between s' and t'. Now, for every edge e of H, pick s_e∈L_r so that the unique H‑path from the root to s_e contains e (this exists for tree‑edges by choosing s_e in the corresponding branch; cycle‑edges lie on an H‑cycle already). Consider the H‑path P_e from s_e to t (concatenating the root–s_e path (which contains e) and a root–t path). Then the closed walk C_e := s_e s'_e · Q(s'_e,t') · t't · P_e in G_1 is a cycle that contains e. Therefore every edge of H lies on some cycle in the resulting graph. Edges added outside H lie in cycles because the backbone is 2‑edge‑connected and attachments from two distinct boundary vertices s,t supply two edge‑disjoint routes into R. Hence the final graph G is bridgeless, has max degree ≤D, and contains an occurrence of F as an r‑ball. Thus U_F^Y meets the bridgeless set. ∎
Remark. The proof uses only D≥3 (the backbone is degree‑≤3). All modifications occur strictly outside the original r‑ball, so the occurrence of F is preserved.

Consequences for coarser/pullback topologies
- By Lemma 1 and Proposition 5, in Y (and hence in the pullback topology τ_any on X via π) the bridgeless set is dense for all D≥3. In ≤D (any D≥2), the complement contains the open set “there exists a leaf”, so bridgeless is not comeagre in Y (nor in τ_any). Thus, in ≤D, bridgeless is nowhere dense under d_• (Theorem 14) but not typical under τ_any either; category differs (nowhere dense vs. not comeagre, dense), although “typicality” status agrees (non‑typical in both).
- In =D, D even, Theorem 3 shows bridgeless is comeagre in both X and Y (hence also in τ_any). In =D, D odd, the no‑go from bridge‑forcing cylinders still applies to any cylinder‑refining Baire topology on X (bridgeless cannot be comeagre).

General no‑go for cylinder‑refining Baire topologies
Proposition 6. Let τ be any Baire topology on X such that every rooted cylinder U_F^X is τ‑open. Then:
- In ≤D, the set “has a bridge” contains the nonempty τ‑open cylinder where the root is a leaf; hence “bridgeless” is not comeagre.
- In =D with odd D, refinements as in Proposition C (δ=1 boundary) yield a nonempty τ‑open set contained in “has a bridge”; again “bridgeless” is not comeagre.
Proof. Nonempty τ‑open subsets cannot be meagre in a Baire space. ∎

Small example (D=3)
Let F be the r‑ball of a path of length 2r in the cubic case (a typical tree‑like ball). The boundary L_r has ≥2 vertices. Attach one new outside neighbour to each of two distinct boundary vertices s,t, and embed a long finite segment of a subdivided ladder between these attachment points. Every edge on the unique root–s path (and similarly root–t path) lies on a cycle obtained by going out via s, across the ladder, and back via t; thus no bridges remain in the union. Degrees remain ≤3, and B_r is unchanged.

Next steps
- Move Lemma 1 (Y is Baire) and Theorem 3 (even‑D regular: bridgeless comeagre) into proofs.md.
- Write a full, explicit version of Proposition 5 with a precise choice of the 2‑edge‑connected backbone (subdivided ladder), an attachment scheme that uses at most one new edge per boundary vertex, and a cycle‑covering argument for all H‑edges.
- Extend Proposition 6 to a larger class of “finite‑lens/pattern‑compatible” topologies explicitly, and record hypotheses under which the argument applies.
- Investigate whether there exists a natural Baire topology on X strictly coarser than τ_any in which “bridgeless” becomes comeagre for ≤D (likely impossible if every “leaf somewhere” set remains open), or prove an impossibility theorem formalizing this no‑go.
- For completeness, include the odd‑D δ=1 gadget proof (unique cross‑edge at the boundary) and the even‑D cut‑vertex forcing cylinder in proofs.md, as they underpin Proposition 6.

New, auditable contributions toward Conjectures 1 and 2

Claims recorded here are self-contained and ready to be curated into notes/proofs.

A) π-transfer and Baire status for the unrooted space (Conj. 1)

- Lemma A1 (π is continuous, open, surjective; Y is Baire).
Let X=𝔾_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm topology τ_• and Y the unrooted space with the rootless-local topology τ₀ generated by cylinders U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. The forgetful map π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G, satisfies: π is continuous (π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{rootings F′ of F} 𝔾_{\bullet}^{F′} open), open (π maps rooted cylinders onto rootless cylinders), and surjective. Since X is Baire (indeed compact metric), Y is Baire as a continuous open image of a Baire space (Oxtoby).
- Proposition A2 (Root-invariance via π).
For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,τ₀) iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,τ_•). If A has the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Reason: continuity+openness yield int(cl(π^{-1}(A)))⊆π^{-1}(int(cl(A))). Meagreness transfers via dense G_δ witnesses and openness.
Use: Resolves Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (all A) and meagreness for BP sets.

B) Finite pinning frameworks (FLP/FPP) and gadgets (Conj. 2 no-go)

- Definitions.
FLP (finite-lens property): every nonempty open O contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) that pins the radius-r neighborhoods of finitely many marked vertices. FPP (finite pinning property): every nonempty open O contains some FLP-cylinder W(M)⊆O.
- Theorem B1 (Bridgeless nowhere dense under FLP; ≤D and =D odd).
For D≥3, in any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D}, BrFree is nowhere dense by pinning a leaf z at a boundary vertex b with residual capacity, forcing bz to be a bridge in all completions. For 𝔾_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, use the explicit pinned seed S: take K_{D+2} with vertices x,a,b,W (|W|=D−1), delete xa,xb and a perfect matching on W. Then deg_S(x)=D−1, others D, S connected. Pin all radius-1 neighborhoods of S far from any marks. In any D-regular completion exactly one cross edge must attach to x, hence that edge is a bridge. Thus BrFree is nowhere dense.
- Proposition B2 (Even-D regular: NoCut nowhere dense under FLP/FPP).
For even D≥4, pin S′: start from K_{D,D} on A∪B, pick x∈A and y₁,y₂∈B; delete x−y₁,x−y₂ and add y₁−y₂. Then deg_{S′}(x)=D−2, others D, and S′ connected. Pin radius-1 neighborhoods. In any D-regular completion all cross edges are forced through x; removing x disconnects, so “no cut vertex” is nowhere dense.
- Proposition B3 (Refinement monotonicity).
If τ₂ refines τ₁ and S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₁), then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₂). Thus no finer metric can make BrFree typical.

C) Unrooted space Y: bridgeless remains small; occurrence pullbacks (Conj. 2, extended no-go)

- Proposition C1 (BrFree is nowhere dense in Y for ≤D and =D odd).
Given any nonempty rootless cylinder U_F^Y, refine to U_{F′}^Y by embedding the same finite pinned gadgets entirely inside F′ (far from the center), ensuring a bridge in every completion. Hence BrFree is nowhere dense in (Y,τ₀).
- Corollary C2 (Occurrence-pullback topologies on X).
For τ_occ generated by Occ(F)=π^{-1}(U_F^Y), BrFree is nowhere dense; thus any root-insensitive occurrence-based metric cannot make BrFree typical.

D) Even-regular classification: bridgeless is typical (new crisp theorem)

- Theorem D1 (Even D-regular, D≥4: BrFree is comeagre in X and Y).
In 𝔾_{\bullet,=D} with even D≥4, 1-way infinite bridges are parity-forbidden (a finite side S would give |δ(S)|≡D|S| (mod 2)=0, contradicting |δ(S)|=1). By Theorem 16, graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge form a meagre (but not nowhere dense) subset. Therefore the complement BrFree is comeagre in both the rooted space X and the unrooted space Y (by π-transfer for BP sets and Y’s Baire property).

E) Bridgeless vs. 2-way bridges: technique underlying Theorem 16 (supporting lemma)

- Lemma E1 (Eliminating bridges near the root by 2-edge-connected replacements).
Fix k and D>2. For any cylinder 𝔾_{\bullet}^{F}, refine to 𝔾_{\bullet}^{F′} by replacing each edge of the k-ball by a 2-edge-connected Θ-gadget (three internally disjoint length-≥2 paths) whose attachments preserve degrees (use internal degree-regularization within the gadget). Then no edge within distance ≤k is a bridge in any completion, and the refinement remains nonempty. Hence “has a 2-way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense; meagreness follows by a countable union over k.
Why useful: Canonical method to prove Theorem 16’s “nowhere dense per k” step while respecting degree bounds.

F) Bounded re-rooting invariance for section metrics (robustness)

- Lemma F1 (Uniformly bounded re-rooting gives homeomorphic section metrics).
If root selectors s,t:Y→X satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤K uniformly, then id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; indeed d_t≤2^{K}d_s and d_s≤2^{K}d_t. Thus typicality is invariant under bounded root changes.

Examples

- D=3 (odd): Take K_5 with vertices x,a,b,w₁,w₂; delete xa, xb, and w₁w₂. Pin radius-1. Only x has residual capacity, forcing exactly one cross edge and hence a bridge in every 3-regular completion.
- D=4 (even): In K_{4,4} with parts A,B, pick x∈A and y₁,y₂∈B; delete x−y₁,x−y₂; add y₁−y₂; pin radius-1. Only x can accept external edges; removing x disconnects → cut vertex.

Obstacles and cautions

- Meagreness equivalence via π requires BP; we avoid claims for arbitrary A⊆Y.
- Any metric/topology with FPP/FLP (and any finer topology) cannot make BrFree typical. A positive answer to Conjecture 2 would require a natural, Baire, non-FPP metric.

Next steps

- Move Lemma A1 and Proposition A2 to proofs.md (settles Conjecture 1 in the intended scope).
- Add Theorem D1 (even-regular: BrFree comeagre) to proofs.md and output.md.
- Include detailed pinning proofs of Theorem B1 and Proposition B2 (explicit gadgets with degree checks) and Lemma E1 (Θ-replacement scheme) in proofs.md.
- Explore non-FPP, Baire metrics (e.g., end-structure/topological end-refinement) and test the category of BrFree therein; either produce a candidate where BrFree is comeagre or extend the no-go.



=== Prover 5 Output ===

Ideas

- Finalize Conjecture 1 rigorously via the quotient map π from rooted to unrooted spaces: prove nowhere‑denseness equivalence; prove meagreness equivalence for sets with the Baire property; deduce Y is Baire. This consolidates the root‑invariance of smallness for all natural properties.
- Settle the even‑D regular case: prove that bridgeless graphs are comeagre in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} for even D≥4 (1‑way bridges parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges meagre). This completes the typicality classification for bridges in the BS topology.
- Record a clean density proof for the set “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” (both in ≤D and in =D), justifying the “not nowhere dense” part of Theorem 16 by exhibiting density.

Quotient map framework (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) topology and let Y be the space of unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with the same degree constraint, endowed with the rootless‑local topology generated by U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. Let π:X→Y be π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is an open quotient). π is continuous, open, surjective; U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open in X.
Proof. For any rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v} \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{(F,v)} is open. Every open subset of X is a union of rooted cylinders; its image is a union of rootless cylinders, hence open. Surjectivity is trivial.

Lemma 2 (closure transport). For all A⊆Y, π^{-1}(\overline{A}^Y)=\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X.
Proof. Closed sets in Y are exactly those whose preimage under π is closed; intersecting over all closed supersets of A yields the identity.

Theorem 3 (nowhere‑dense equivalence). A⊆Y is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. If A is nowhere dense then int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)=∅. If U⊆X is nonempty open with U⊆\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X, then π(U) is nonempty open (Lemma 1) and π(U)⊆\overline{A}^Y (Lemma 2), contradiction. The converse is analogous.

Corollary 4 (meagreness equivalence for BP sets). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not. Then ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y with A∩V comeagre in V. Write V\(A∩V)⊆⋃ N_i with N_i nowhere dense. In π^{-1}(V), each π^{-1}(N_i) is nowhere dense by Theorem 3, so π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(V)\⋃ π^{-1}(N_i) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of π^{-1}(A).

Lemma 5 (Y is Baire). Y is a Baire space.
Proof. Continuous open surjections map Baire spaces to Baire spaces: given dense open D_n⊆Y, each π^{-1}(D_n) is dense open in X (openness shows density of preimages), hence ⋂_n π^{-1}(D_n) is dense in Baire X, so ⋂_n D_n≠∅.

Even‑D regular case: bridgeless is comeagre

Theorem 6. In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} for even D≥4, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre.
Proof. In a D‑regular graph with even D, a 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component S with exactly one cross edge. But for any finite S, the number of edges leaving S equals Σ_{v∈S}(D−deg_S(v))=D|S|−2|E(S)|, which is even when D is even; hence no 1‑way infinite bridge exists. Therefore “has a bridge” = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” in this space. By Theorem 16, the latter set is meagre, so its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Density of the 2‑way infinite bridge property (supports Theorem 16: “not nowhere dense”)

Proposition 7 (≤D case). For any D≥3, in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D} the set A of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof. Fix a rooted r‑ball F and ε>0. Build an extension H as follows. Choose a boundary vertex u (distance r). Attach a simple path P of length L≫r starting from u using fresh vertices, respecting degree bound ≤D by making each new interior vertex of P have two path neighbors and at most D−2 additional leaves (to be added later if needed) to keep degrees ≤D. At the far end x of P, create two infinite components L and R: for instance, attach two infinite (D−1)‑ary trees to x via a new vertex y adjacent only to x (so x–y forms an edge e), and saturate degrees elsewhere by adding leaves so that degrees stay ≤D and both components are infinite. By construction, e is the only edge between the two infinite parts; removing e disconnects H into two infinite components. Since F was preserved inside radius r, H lies in the cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, proving density.

Proposition 8 (=D case). For any D≥3, in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} the set A of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof sketch. Given F, extend it outside radius r by a long simple path P of length L from a boundary vertex u, and at each new interior vertex z of P attach D−2 disjoint D‑regular “degree‑saturating” finite gadgets (e.g., copies of K_{D+1}−e pinned so that z gains exactly one new neighbor per gadget, all gadgets internally D‑regular) to keep deg(z)=D. At the terminal vertex x of P, introduce a new vertex y and set e=xy to be the prospective bridge. Now grow two disjoint infinite D‑regular components L and R from x and y, respectively, using an iterative degree‑completion process: whenever a vertex has residual degree r∈{1,…,D−1}, attach a fresh copy of K_{D+1}−e and identify one deficit port to raise its degree by 1 while keeping all new vertices at degree D; proceed along a spanning tree to infinity on each side to ensure the components are infinite. No edges are added between the two sides except e. All vertices (including x,y) have degree D at the end. Then e is a bridge whose removal leaves two infinite components. Since F is unchanged within B_r, the constructed graph lies in \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, proving density.

Remarks on gadgets used above

- The port gadget Q_D=K_{D+1}−e has two deficit vertices of degree D−1 and all others degree D; gluing its deficit vertices to a given vertex raises its degree by 1 while keeping all new vertices at degree D. This provides a local degree‑completion tool in D‑regular constructions.
- Degree‑bounded case admits the simpler tree/leaf attachments because only the upper bound Δ≤D needs to be respected.

Why useful here: Propositions 7–8 provide the “not nowhere dense” half of Theorem 16 by showing that the 2‑way infinite bridge property is dense (hence its closure has nonempty interior), while meagreness follows by the standard “distance‑k occurrence” decomposition.

Examples

- Parity check for even D. For D=4 and any finite S, edges leaving S count to 4|S|−2|E(S)|, even; hence no 1‑way infinite bridge can split off a finite S.
- Odd D regular, D=3. The Q_3 gadget (K_4−e) reduces boundary deficit by 2 per application; iterative use forces δ=1 in a finite refinement, yielding exactly one cross edge in any 3‑regular completion and hence a 1‑way infinite bridge (Theorem 14(ii) forcing scheme).

Obstacles

- Meagreness transfer beyond Baire‑property sets is generally false for quotients; our results explicitly restrict to sets with the Baire property (Borel/analytic), which covers all properties under consideration.
- While density of 2‑way infinite bridges is established, giving the full formal write‑up of the regular completion (Proposition 8) requires a compact degree‑completion lemma (e.g., via Erdős–Gallai) to ensure simple graphs; the sketched gadget‑based completion is standard but should be detailed in proofs.md.

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Lemma 5 into proofs.md to finalize Conjecture 1 (nowhere‑denseness and meagreness for BP sets are root‑invariant; Y is Baire).
- Add a full proof of Theorem 6 (even‑D regular bridgeless is comeagre) to output.md and proofs.md.
- Write the detailed gadget‑based regular completion for Proposition 8: formalize the use of Q_D attachments to realize any finite pattern with prescribed localized deficits and extend to infinite D‑regular components while keeping e the unique cross edge.
- For Conjecture 2, keep the no‑go region: any topology with rooted cylinders as a base preserves typicality (bridgeless remains nowhere dense for ≤D and odd D). Investigate a specific coarser “tail” topology; we already observed that both bridgeful and bridgeless sets have nonempty interior there. If the tail space is Baire, neither set can be comeagre, precluding bridgeless typicality in that topology as well. Prove (or refute) Baire‑ness of the tail topology via an inverse‑limit or quotient construction.
