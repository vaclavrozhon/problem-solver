Several drafts assumed \u03c0:X\u2192Y is continuous for the unrooted \u201coccurs\u2011somewhere\u201d topology. That is false in general: preimages \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in the rooted local topology because \u201coccurs somewhere\u201d does not constrain the root. Nonetheless, \u03c0 is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders). Consequences: (i) Nowhere\u2011denseness transfers from Y to X using openness (A ND in Y \u21d2 \u03c0^{-1}(A) ND in X); (ii) the converse and any meagreness equivalences cannot rely on \u03c0\u2019s continuity.

Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1 and connect each v\u2208L to D\u2212deg_F(v) distinct vertices of W (total c edges), thereby saturating all vertices of L to degree D in the augmented graph. Next add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t\u2212c\u22121)/2. Choosing t\u2265c with t\u2261c+1 (mod 2) makes e_W an integer; take t large enough so a simple graph on W with degrees \u2264D exists (greedy construction). Let F\u2032 be the resulting R:=r+1 ball. Property (i) holds by construction and S(F\u2032)=D t\u2212(c+2e_W)=1, proving (ii). In any D\u2011regular completion, |\u03b4(V(B_R))|=S(F\u2032)=1, so the sole crossing edge is a bridge; as V(B_R) is finite, it is 1\u2011way infinite. \u220e\\n\\nEven\u2011D regular cut\u2011vertex forcing\\n\\nTheorem 5 (Even\u2011D: forcing a cut vertex inside a ball).\\nLet D\u22654 be even and let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) occur in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D}.

Work inside the finite graph K_{D+2}. Delete a fixed perfect matching M to obtain a D\u2011regular connected graph R. Pick distinct vertices x,y,z with yz\u2208M (so yz\u2209E(R)). Delete edges xy and xz and add the edge yz. In the modified graph R*, deg(x)=D\u22122 and all other vertices have degree D; moreover R*\u2212x is connected. Graft a copy of R* disjointly outside the boundary L_r of F and pin all adjacency within radius 1 of each vertex of R* so that, in F\u2032, all vertices of distance <R other than \u03c1 are saturated to degree D, while the root \u03c1 has degree D\u22122 (route the attachment so that \u03c1 plays the role of x). Then S(F\u2032)=2 and any D\u2011regular completion must add exactly two cross edges, both incident to \u03c1, making \u03c1 a cut vertex. \u220e\\n\\nEven\u2011D regular classification\\n\\nTheorem 6 (Even\u2011D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).\\nLet D\u22654 be even. In X=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} with the BS topology, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre.\\nProof. In a D\u2011regular graph with even D, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component H with |\u03b4(V(H))|=1. But for any finite induced subgraph H of a D\u2011regular graph G, |\u03b4_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|\u22122|E(H)| is even. Hence 1\u2011way infinite bridges cannot occur. By Theorem 16 (from the original note), graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Therefore \u201chas a bridge\u201d is meagre in X and its complement is comeagre. \u220e\\n\\nEliminating bridges near the root (Theorem 16: \u2018nowhere dense per k\u2019)\\n\\nLemma 7 (\u0398\u2011replacement forbids near\u2011root bridges).\\nFix D>2 and k\u2208\\\\mathbb{N}.

Let E_k be the set of edges of F whose endpoints lie at distance \u2264k from the root. For each e=uv\u2208E_k, delete uv and insert a 2\u2011terminal, 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadget \u0398_e with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e\u2013t_e paths (e.g., a \u03b8\u2011graph with path lengths 2 and 3), and add edges u\u2013s_e and v\u2013t_e. This preserves deg(u),deg(v) and keeps all newly introduced degrees \u22643\u2264D. Perform these replacements for all e\u2208E_k using pairwise disjoint gadgets placed beyond the current radius as needed; let F\u2032 be the resulting refined ball. In any completion, each replaced segment lies on a cycle within \u0398_e, so no edge at distance \u2264k from the root can be a bridge. \u220e\\n\\nDensity of 2\u2011way infinite bridges in the \u2264D space\\n\\nLemma 8 (\u2264D: density of 2\u2011way infinite bridge property).\\nLet D\u22653.

From a boundary vertex u at distance r, attach a simple path P of large length L using fresh vertices, keeping degrees \u2264D (internal vertices of P have two path neighbors and at most D\u22122 new leaves if needed later). At the terminal x of P, create two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single new edge e so that deleting e separates the two infinite parts. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r so B_r remains F. Then e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge and the resulting rooted graph lies in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet}^F. \u220e\\n\\nRemarks.\\n- Proposition 2 provides a one\u2011way transfer of nowhere denseness from Y to X using only that \u03c0 is open; the converse direction generally fails due to lack of continuity (Lemma 1(ii)).\\n- Propositions 3\u20135 supply root\u2011independent forcing mechanisms used in cylinder\u2011based and finite\u2011pinning topologies.\\n- Lemma 7 formalizes the \u2018nowhere dense per k\u2019 step in Theorem 16 while preserving degree constraints.\\n\"},\"output_update\":null}",
