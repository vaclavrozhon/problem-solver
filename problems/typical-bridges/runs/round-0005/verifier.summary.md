We corrected a core assumption: π is open but not continuous for the unrooted “occurs‑somewhere” topology, so previous ND/meagre equivalences via π must be revised. We adopt a root‑free cylinder criterion for ND of saturated sets, which settles Conjecture 1 (ND part) rigorously. For Conjecture 2, cylinder/finite‑lens topologies cannot change typicality; the odd‑D bridge‑forcing and even‑D cut‑vertex gadgets are now clean. We formalized the distance‑k exclusion for Theorem 16 via Θ‑replacements. New: in =D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre (parity + Theorem 16). Next: analyze Baire properties and category under genuinely coarser root‑insensitive topologies.
