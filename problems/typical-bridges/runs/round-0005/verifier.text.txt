{"feedback_md":"Key corrections and consolidations this round:\n\n1) Forgetful map π. Several drafts assumed π:X→Y is continuous for the unrooted “occurs‑somewhere” topology. That is false in general: preimages π^{-1}(U_F^Y) need not be open in the rooted local topology because “occurs somewhere” does not constrain the root. Nonetheless, π is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders). Consequences: (i) Nowhere‑denseness transfers from Y to X using openness (A ND in Y ⇒ π^{-1}(A) ND in X); (ii) the converse and any meagreness equivalences cannot rely on π’s continuity. Use root‑free cylinder criteria on X for saturated sets instead. Please retract claims of full ND/meagre equivalence based solely on π’s continuity.\n\n2) Conjecture 1 — ND part. The root‑free criterion for saturated sets S⊆X is correct and sufficient: S is ND iff every unrooted ball B admits a refinement B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\\S. This avoids π entirely and yields a genuinely root‑independent statement.\n\n3) Conjecture 2 — local no‑go. The cylinder/finite‑lens (and any finer) topologies preserve all ND/meagre outcomes proved by cylinder refinements. The odd‑D bridge‑forcing (δ=1) gadget and the even‑D cut‑vertex forcing gadget are now correct; ensure radius‑1 pinning of all gadget vertices with degree D so no external edges can attach. Any metric equivalent to d_• (e.g., d_new mixes) cannot change typicality; please retract contrary claims.\n\n4) Theorem 16 formalization. The “nowhere dense at distance ≤k” step is rigorous via 2‑terminal 2‑edge‑connected (Θ) replacements, preserving degrees (≤D) in both ≤D and =D spaces.\n\n5) Even‑D classification. In =D with even D, 1‑way bridges are parity‑forbidden; 2‑way bridges are meagre; hence bridgeless is comeagre. This positive typicality result should be recorded and is added to proofs/output.\n\nNext steps: (i) Remove reliance on π‑continuity: replace with (a) π open one‑way ND transfer, and (b) the root‑free ND criterion; (ii) keep odd‑D δ=1 and even‑D cut‑vertex gadgets fully pinned; (iii) analyze Baire status and category under genuinely coarser topologies (occurrence/tail); (iv) if aiming at meagreness transfer, use Banach–Mazur game on saturated cylinders within X rather than π.\n","summary_md":"We corrected a core assumption: π is open but not continuous for the unrooted “occurs‑somewhere” topology, so previous ND/meagre equivalences via π must be revised.

The forgetful map π:X→Y (rooted→unrooted) is surjective and open (images of rooted cylinders are rootless cylinders), but not continuous for the rootless “occurs‑somewhere” topology in general. Thus ND/meagreness equivalences cannot rely on π’s continuity.\n\n- Root‑free ND criterion (Conjecture 1, ND part). For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense iff for every unrooted r‑ball B there exists B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\\S.

(i) If (G,ρ)∈\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F then G contains an r‑ball isomorphic to F at ρ, so π(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F)⊆U_F^Y. Conversely, if G∈U_F^Y via v, then (G,v)∈\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F and (G,v)∈π^{-1}(U_F^Y). Thus equality holds and π is open and surjective.\n(ii) Fix D≥3 and let F be any rooted r‑ball containing a cycle. Construct G by starting from a rooted infinite tree T (degree ≤D) and, at distance N≫r from ρ, graft a finite connected graph H_0 which contains a copy of F (as the r‑ball around some vertex), ensuring no other vertex of G has an r‑ball isomorphic to F (e.g., make T and the rest cycle‑free, and keep H_0 finite). Then G∈U_F^Y. For any s<N, modify G outside B_s(G,ρ) by replacing H_0 with a tree of maximum degree ≤D to obtain H. Then B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) but H∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y), showing π^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open. ∎\n\nProposition 2 (One‑way transfer of nowhere denseness via openness).\nIf A⊆Y is nowhere dense in Y then π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. Let U be nonempty open in X. Then π(U) is nonempty open in Y. Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U′:=U∩π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and U′∩π^{-1}(A)=∅. Hence π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. ∎\n\nRoot‑free criterion for saturated sets\nFor an unrooted r‑ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B):=⋃_{v∈V(B)} \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{(B,v)}⊆X.\n\nProposition 3 (Root‑free characterization of nowhere denseness in X for saturated sets).\nLet S⊆X be saturated (i.e., re‑rooting within the same unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r‑ball B there exists an unrooted r′‑ball B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\\S.\nProof. (⇒) If S is nowhere dense, every nonempty open set contains a smaller nonempty open set disjoint from S. Cyl(B) is a finite union of rooted cylinders, hence nonempty open whenever B occurs. Thus there is a rooted r′‑ball F′ with \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F′}⊂Cyl(B)\\S. Let B′ be the underlying unrooted ball of F′; then Cyl(B′)=⋃_{w} \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{(B′,w)}⊂Cyl(B)\\S by saturation of S.\n(⇐) Conversely, let U be nonempty open in X; pick a rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F⊂U with underlying unrooted B. By hypothesis choose B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\\S. Then Cyl(B′) is a nonempty open subset of U disjoint from S. Hence S is nowhere dense. ∎\n\nOdd‑D regular bridge forcing\nLet D≥3 be odd. For a finite connected graph F, define S(F):=∑_{v∈V(F)}(D−deg_F(v))=D|V(F)|−2|E(F)|. In any D‑regular completion H⊇F, the number of edges crossing the cut δ_H(V(F)) equals S(F).\n\nTheorem 4 (Odd‑D: forcing a unique crossing edge inside a ball).\nLet D≥3 be odd and let F=B_r(G,ρ) be any rooted r‑ball that occurs in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r+1 and a rooted R‑ball F′ extending F with the properties:\n(i) every vertex at distance <R from the root in F′ has degree D within F′;\n(ii) S(F′)=1;\n(iii) for any D‑regular graph G′ with B_R(G′,ρ)≅F′, the unique edge of δ_{G′}(V(B_R(G′,ρ))) is a (1‑way infinite) bridge.\nProof. Let L=L_r be the boundary of F and set c=∑_{v∈L}(D−deg_F(v))=S(F)≥1. Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1 and connect each v∈L to D−deg_F(v) distinct vertices of W (total c edges), thereby saturating all vertices of L to degree D in the augmented graph. Next add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t−c−1)/2. Choosing t≥c with t≡c+1 (mod 2) makes e_W an integer; take t large enough so a simple graph on W with degrees ≤D exists (greedy construction). Let F′ be the resulting R:=r+1 ball. Property (i) holds by construction and S(F′)=D t−(c+2e_W)=1, proving (ii). In any D‑regular completion, |δ(V(B_R))|=S(F′)=1, so the sole crossing edge is a bridge; as V(B_R) is finite, it is 1‑way infinite. ∎\n\nEven‑D regular cut‑vertex forcing\n\nTheorem 5 (Even‑D: forcing a cut vertex inside a ball).\nLet D≥4 be even and let F=B_r(G,ρ) occur in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r and a rooted R‑ball F′ extending F with the properties:\n(i) every vertex at distance <R other than the root ρ has degree D within F′;\n(ii) deg_{F′}(ρ)=D−2;\n(iii) for any D‑regular graph G′ with B_R(G′,ρ)≅F′, the root ρ is a cut vertex of G′.\nProof. Work inside the finite graph K_{D+2}. Delete a fixed perfect matching M to obtain a D‑regular connected graph R. Pick distinct vertices x,y,z with yz∈M (so yz∉E(R)). Delete edges xy and xz and add the edge yz. In the modified graph R*, deg(x)=D−2 and all other vertices have degree D; moreover R*−x is connected. Graft a copy of R* disjointly outside the boundary L_r of F and pin all adjacency within radius 1 of each vertex of R* so that, in F′, all vertices of distance <R other than ρ are saturated to degree D, while the root ρ has degree D−2 (route the attachment so that ρ plays the role of x). Then S(F′)=2 and any D‑regular completion must add exactly two cross edges, both incident to ρ, making ρ a cut vertex. ∎\n\nEven‑D regular classification\n\nTheorem 6 (Even‑D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).\nLet D≥4 be even. In X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with the BS topology, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre.\nProof. In a D‑regular graph with even D, a 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component H with |δ(V(H))|=1. But for any finite induced subgraph H of a D‑regular graph G, |δ_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)| is even. Hence 1‑way infinite bridges cannot occur. By Theorem 16 (from the original note), graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Therefore “has a bridge” is meagre in X and its complement is comeagre. ∎\n\nEliminating bridges near the root (Theorem 16: ‘nowhere dense per k’)\n\nLemma 7 (Θ‑replacement forbids near‑root bridges).\nFix D>2 and k∈\\mathbb{N}. For any rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F}⊆X, there exists a refined rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F′}⊂\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F} such that in every extension of F′ no edge at distance ≤k from the root is a bridge.\nProof. Let E_k be the set of edges of F whose endpoints lie at distance ≤k from the root. For each e=uv∈E_k, delete uv and insert a 2‑terminal, 2‑edge‑connected gadget Θ_e with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e–t_e paths (e.g., a θ‑graph with path lengths 2 and 3), and add edges u–s_e and v–t_e. This preserves deg(u),deg(v) and keeps all newly introduced degrees ≤3≤D. Perform these replacements for all e∈E_k using pairwise disjoint gadgets placed beyond the current radius as needed; let F′ be the resulting refined ball. In any completion, each replaced segment lies on a cycle within Θ_e, so no edge at distance ≤k from the root can be a bridge. ∎\n\nDensity of 2‑way infinite bridges in the ≤D space\n\nLemma 8 (≤D: density of 2‑way infinite bridge property).\nLet D≥3. In \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,≤D}, the set of rooted graphs that admit a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.\nProof. Fix F=B_r(G,ρ). From a boundary vertex u at distance r, attach a simple path P of large length L using fresh vertices, keeping degrees ≤D (internal vertices of P have two path neighbors and at most D−2 new leaves if needed later). At the terminal x of P, create two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single new edge e so that deleting e separates the two infinite parts. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r so B_r remains F. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge and the resulting rooted graph lies in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^F. ∎\n\nRemarks.\n- Proposition 2 provides a one‑way transfer of nowhere denseness from Y to X using only that π is open; the converse direction generally fails due to lack of continuity (Lemma 1(ii)).\n- Propositions 3–5 supply root‑independent forcing mechanisms used in cylinder‑based and finite‑pinning topologies.\n- Lemma 7 formalizes the ‘nowhere dense per k’ step in Theorem 16 while preserving degree constraints.\n"},"output_update":null}
