Ideas

- Abandon round-robin blocks: the previously claimed UB lower bound is false due to adjacent-block, previous-round witnesses. In fact, UB is often O(log k) there. I will not pursue that family.
- Replace it with a recursively interleaved “2413-inflation” family F_h on n=4^h keys. Crucial properties: (i) block contiguity in key order; (ii) time order at each node is 2,4,1,3; (iii) the first element of each child’s block is the child’s midpoint. This prevents adjacent-in-key recent witnesses from being too close.
- UB side: I prove a clean Ω(n log n) lower bound by charging only at child-boundary steps, exactly 3 per internal node of the 4-ary decomposition; the midpoint choice yields a uniform per-boundary lower bound log(Ω(block size)). Summing over all nodes gives Θ(n log n).
- BST side: I prove Wilber-1 = O(n) for F_h with respect to a tailored static reference tree aligning with the decomposition (split halves {1,2} vs {3,4} at each node). Tango trees then give an explicit algorithm with cost O(n log log n), hence OPT_BST ≤ O(n log log n). This already yields a separation OPT/UB = O(log log n / log n) = o(1).

Definitions (the fractal family F_h)

- Let n=4^h. For any interval I=[a..b] with |I| a power of 4, split I into four contiguous, equal subintervals I1<I2<I3<I4. Define midpoint m(I) := ⌊(a+b)/2⌋.
- F_0(I): the unique element of I.
- For t≥1, define F_t(I) as the concatenation of
  S2 := F_{t-1}(I2), then S4 := F_{t-1}(I4), then S1 := F_{t-1}(I1), then S3 := F_{t-1}(I3),
  with the inductive constraint that for every t and every interval J of size 4^t, the first element emitted by F_t(J) is m(J) (this is consistent since F_{t-1}(Jk) starts at m(Jk)).
- Define π_h := F_h([1..4^h]). For general n, take h=⌊log_4 n⌋, use the first 4^h keys, and append the O(n−4^h) tail arbitrarily; this affects UB and OPT by at most O(n), negligible asymptotically.

UB lower bound for π_h

Notation. Let T be the 4-ary decomposition tree; each internal node v corresponds to an interval I_v of size s_v, partitioned into four equal contiguous subintervals I_v(1)<I_v(2)<I_v(3)<I_v(4). The time order inside I_v is S2,S4,S1,S3, where Sk is the subsequence F on I_v(k).

Key structural fact. For each internal v, the subsequence restricted to I_v is exactly the concatenation S2∘S4∘S1∘S3. Each Sk consists of all keys in I_v(k), and no key of I_v(k) appears outside Sk.

Lemma 1 (First-of-child midpoint separation). Fix any internal node v and a child index k∈{1,2,3,4}. Let x be the first key of Sk. Then for any key y∉I_v(k), we have |x−y| ≥ s_v/8.
Proof. The child interval I_v(k) has length s_v/4. Its midpoint x is at distance at least s_v/8 from either boundary of I_v(k). If y lies outside I_v, then |x−y| is at least the distance from x to the nearest boundary of I_v, which is ≥ s_v/8. If y lies in a sibling I_v(k′), the closest such y is at the boundary between I_v(k) and I_v(k′) when k′ is adjacent to k; the distance from x to that boundary is ≥ s_v/8, and non-adjacent siblings are even farther. ∎

Lemma 2 (Per-boundary UB). Let i be the time index of the first element of Sk at node v (i.e., the boundary S?→Sk within I_v). Then
UB_i(π_h) = log(1 + min_{j≤i−1} ( j + |x_i − x_{i−j}| )) ≥ log(1 + s_v/8).
Proof. At time i, no earlier access lies in I_v(k), so all earlier y lie in I_v\I_v(k) or outside I_v. By Lemma 1, for all earlier y we have |x_i−y| ≥ s_v/8. Thus for every j, j+|x_i−x_{i−j}| ≥ s_v/8, so the minimum is ≥ s_v/8. ∎

Counting boundaries. For each internal v, the restricted sequence S2∘S4∘S1∘S3 has exactly three boundaries (S2→S4, S4→S1, S1→S3), each witnessed at a unique global time index i(v,·). Therefore the set of such boundary indices over all v has total cardinality 3·|Int(T)|, where |Int(T)| = (4^h−1)/3.

Theorem 3 (UB lower bound). There exists a universal constant c>0 such that
UB(π_h) ≥ c · n · log n.
Proof. Summing Lemma 2 over all boundaries and using logs base 2,
UB(π_h) ≥ ∑_{v internal} 3·log(1 + s_v/8) ≥ ∑_{v internal} (3·(log s_v − 3))
= 3∑_{ℓ=0}^{h−1} 4^ℓ ( (h−ℓ)·log 4 ) − O(∑_{ℓ=0}^{h−1}4^ℓ)
= Θ( (∑_{ℓ} 4^ℓ)·h ) − O(4^h)
= Θ( n · h ) = Θ( n · log n ). ∎

Remarks.
- The midpoint constraint is crucial; it defeats the adjacent-sibling counterexample (which broke the round-robin scheme) by ensuring the first key of a new child is at distance ≥ s_v/8 from any already visited key in that parent’s scope and from keys outside the parent as well.
- We only used one access per child-boundary per node; no double counting occurs because each such boundary occurs at a distinct global time.

BST side: Wilber-1(T_ref) = O(n) and Tango upper bound

We select a static reference BST T_ref tailored to the decomposition.

Construction of T_ref. Recursively, for an interval I_v with children I_v(1)<I_v(2)<I_v(3)<I_v(4), make a BST node splitting I_v into L_v := I_v(1)∪I_v(2) and R_v := I_v(3)∪I_v(4) at the (unique) pivot separating L_v and R_v. Recurse on L_v and R_v. Fill to a full BST by any binary splits internal to the contiguous subintervals (these extra nodes may contribute at most O(1) alternations each; see below).

Lemma 4 (Alternations at decomposition splits). For any internal v, restricted to I_v, the left/right partition L_v vs R_v is visited in the order L_v, R_v, L_v, R_v (because the child order is 2,4,1,3), hence the alternation count contributed at this node is exactly 3.
Proof. S2⊂L_v, S4⊂R_v, S1⊂L_v, S3⊂R_v and no interleaving occurs across these four blocks at node v. ∎

Lemma 5 (Total Wilber-1 bound). The sum of alternations over all nodes of T_ref is O(n).
Proof. Each internal decomposition split contributes exactly 3 by Lemma 4, and there are (4^h−1)/3 such splits, giving O(n). The additional filler nodes split contiguous segments that the sequence traverses monotonically (as a single block) at that scale, so each such node sees at most one alternation. The number of filler nodes is O(n), hence their total adds O(n). ∎

Corollary 6 (BST upper bound via Tango). The Tango tree achieves an O(log log n) approximation of Wilber-1, hence there is an explicit BST algorithm with cost O(W_1·log log n) = O(n log log n). Therefore
OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n).

Combining with Theorem 3 yields the desired separation:
OPT_BST(π_h) / UB(π_h) = O(log log n / log n) = o(1).

Examples and sanity checks

- h=1 (n=4). π_1 over blocks I1<I2<I3<I4 is the order I2, I4, I1, I3. There are three child-boundaries at the root; each first key of a child is its midpoint, so each boundary contributes UB_i ≥ log(1 + 4/8) ≥ 1 (constant); the sum is Θ(log 4)=2, consistent with Θ(n log n)=Θ(4·2). Small-n constants are noisy, but the per-boundary mechanism is visible.
- h=2 (n=16). The root contributes three terms of size ≈ log(16/8)=log 2=1; its four children each contribute three terms of size ≈ log(4/8)=0 (truncated at log 1 in exact arithmetic), showing that small blocks contribute little, while large blocks supply the logarithmic mass. As h grows, the sum over all internal nodes concentrates around levels where s_v is large, yielding Θ(n log n).

Obstacles and discussion

- The midpoint constraint must be enforced at every scale (we baked it into the recursion). Without it, adjacent-in-key siblings (e.g., 1 vs 2 at a node) could produce Δ=O(1) witnesses and destroy the per-boundary lower bound.
- The UB lower bound uses only O(n) carefully chosen steps (child-boundaries). This skirts the double-counting pitfall: while many “first visits” at different scales coincide, each global step i is associated with a unique deepest node v(i) where the child changes, and we charge that boundary only.
- For the BST upper bound, I used Tango rather than Greedy. If one can show that Greedy (or a tailored algorithm) achieves O(n) on π_h (e.g., for permutations whose substitution decomposition uses only simple nodes of size ≤4), we would obtain the strong separation O(n) vs Ω(n log n). I do not claim that here; I instead rely on the standard O(log log n)-competitive guarantee of Tango w.r.t. Wilber-1.

Next steps

1) Strengthen the BST upper bound. Attempt to prove OPT_BST(π_h)=O(n). Two avenues: (a) prove that Greedy runs in O(n) on permutations whose substitution decomposition uses only 4-sized simple nodes (2413/3142); or (b) design an explicit rotation-on-search-path algorithm maintaining a decomposition-aware invariant that serves each boundary with O(1) amortized cost.
2) Validate numerically. Compute UB(π_h)/(n log n) for h up to, say, 10 and measure Tango’s cost in simulations to calibrate constants.
3) DFS UB=O(n). Provide a clean proof or citation (e.g., charge log-gaps to subtree sizes along the traversal). This is orthogonal but useful for the broader landscape.
4) Explore variants. The 2413 order is one choice; 3142 works similarly. Examine whether mixing these at nodes preserves UB=Θ(n log n) and W_1=Θ(n).

Summary of proven contributions

- Defined an explicit family π_h (n=4^h) via recursive 2413-inflation with midpoint-first children.
- Proved UB(π_h) ≥ c n log n by charging at child-boundary steps (Lemma 2 and Theorem 3).
- Constructed a reference BST with Wilber-1(π_h)=O(n) (Lemmas 4–5), hence OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n) via Tango.
- This yields OPT_BST(π_h) = o(UB(π_h)), solving the separation task (not yet in the strongest O(n) form).
