UB lower bound: charge only at child-boundary times and use an LCA/bijection between consecutive pairs and node-boundaries; midpoints give rank-distance \u2265 s_v/8 to any earlier key, so those boundary steps contribute \u0398(log s_v). Summing over levels yields UB(\u03c0_h)=\u0398(n log n). BST upper bound: choose a static reference tree that splits (I1\u222aI2) vs (I3\u222aI4) recursively; each decomposition node produces O(1) alternations so Wilber-1 = O(n). Tango trees then give an explicit algorithm with cost O(n log log n), hence OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(n log log n). This achieves OPT = o(UB) (non-strong separation).
