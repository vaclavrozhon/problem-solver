{"summary_md":"Last round corrected earlier mistakes (bit-reversal and round-robin families) and introduced a new explicit permutation family π_h (n=4^h): a recursively interleaved 2413-inflation with a midpoint-first constraint and child order 2,4,1,3. UB lower bound: charge only at child-boundary times and use an LCA/bijection between consecutive pairs and node-boundaries; midpoints give rank-distance ≥ s_v/8 to any earlier key, so those boundary steps contribute Θ(log s_v). Summing over levels yields UB(π_h)=Θ(n log n). BST upper bound: choose a static reference tree that splits (I1∪I2) vs (I3∪I4) recursively; each decomposition node produces O(1) alternations so Wilber-1 = O(n). Tango trees then give an explicit algorithm with cost O(n log log n), hence OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n). This achieves OPT = o(UB) (non-strong separation). Next formal tasks: make the LCA/boundary bijection and Wilber-1/filler-node accounting fully rigorous.
