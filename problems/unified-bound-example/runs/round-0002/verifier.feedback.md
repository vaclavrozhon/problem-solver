Key points:

- Prover 1: Your revised bit-reversal analysis is now correct in the sense that it proves only UB = Ω(n) and retracts the Θ(n log n) claim. However, your new UB(F_h) = Θ(n log n) lower bound via per-level events E_ℓ is flawed: the claim “for j ≤ s_ℓ, t−j lies in the preceding block B” is false (those t−j are still in the same child D), so the essential step forcing large Δ for all small j fails. This argument must be abandoned. The 2413 fractal family remains promising, but use the boundary/LCA charging approach (see below) rather than scale events.

- Prover 2: Your round-robin block construction was rightly abandoned. Your new recursively interleaved 2413-inflation with midpoint-first constraint is strong. The UB lower bound argument that charges only at child-boundaries is the right fix: at each internal node v with interval size s_v, the time i that begins a new child block contributes UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8) because earlier accesses are outside that child and the midpoint guarantees rank-distance ≥ s_v/8. The crucial point is counting these boundary times without double counting: the three boundaries per internal node (S2→S4, S4→S1, S1→S3) are in bijection with the n−1 consecutive-pair transitions, via the LCA in the 4-ary decomposition tree. This disjointness must be stated and proved (simple induction or LCA argument). Summing gives UB(π_h) ≥ Θ(n log n); the trivial UB ≤ n log n yields UB(π_h) = Θ(n log n).

- BST side (Prover 2): The Wilber-1 bound with the tailored static reference tree that splits {I1∪I2} vs {I3∪I4} at each node is sound. At each decomposition node the restricted sequence is L,R,L,R, hence exactly 3 alternations. Filling each contiguous interval to a full BST adds O(1) alternations per filler node; total W1 = O(n). Tango then gives an explicit O(W1 log log n) = O(n log log n) algorithm, yielding OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n) and thus OPT/UB = O(log log n/log n) = o(1). This resolves the separation task (non-strong form).

Concrete next steps:
- Prover 1: Drop the E_ℓ approach; adopt the boundary/LCA charging. Provide a clean DFS UB = O(n) proof (charging to subtree sizes) and keep the bit-reversal status as Ω(n) with numerics for clarity.
- Prover 2: Formalize rigorously: (i) the midpoint separation lemma; (ii) the bijection between consecutive pairs and node-boundaries via LCA; (iii) W1(T_ref) = O(n) including filler-node alternations. Then state the final theorem and corollary via Tango.
- Both: Optional but valuable: attempt to strengthen OPT to O(n) (e.g., prove Greedy is O(n) on this 4-decomposable family or design a tailored BST with O(1) amortized per boundary). Also add empirical UB for π_h up to h≈10 for constants.
