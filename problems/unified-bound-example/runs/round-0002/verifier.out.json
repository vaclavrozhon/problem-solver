  "feedback_md": "Key points:\n\n- Prover 1: Your revised bit-reversal analysis is now correct in the sense that it proves only UB = \u03a9(n) and retracts the \u0398(n log n) claim. However, your new UB(F_h) = \u0398(n log n) lower bound via per-level events E_\u2113 is flawed: the claim \u201cfor j \u2264 s_\u2113, t\u2212j lies in the preceding block B\u201d is false (those t\u2212j are still in the same child D), so the essential step forcing large \u0394 for all small j fails. This argument must be abandoned. The 2413 fractal family remains promising, but use the boundary/LCA charging approach (see below) rather than scale events.\n\n- Prover 2: Your round-robin block construction was rightly abandoned. Your new recursively interleaved 2413-inflation with midpoint-first constraint is strong. The UB lower bound argument that charges only at child-boundaries is the right fix: at each internal node v with interval size s_v, the time i that begins a new child block contributes UB_i \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8) because earlier accesses are outside that child and the midpoint guarantees rank-distance \u2265 s_v/8. The crucial point is counting these boundary times without double counting: the three boundaries per internal node (S2\u2192S4, S4\u2192S1, S1\u2192S3) are in bijection with the n\u22121 consecutive-pair transitions, via the LCA in the 4-ary decomposition tree. This disjointness must be stated and proved (simple induction or LCA argument). Summing gives UB(\u03c0_h) \u2265 \u0398(n log n); the trivial UB \u2264 n log n yields UB(\u03c0_h) = \u0398(n log n).\n\n- BST side (Prover 2): The Wilber-1 bound with the tailored static reference tree that splits {I1\u222aI2} vs {I3\u222aI4} at each node is sound. At each decomposition node the restricted sequence is L,R,L,R, hence exactly 3 alternations. Filling each contiguous interval to a full BST adds O(1) alternations per filler node; total W1 = O(n). Tango then gives an explicit O(W1 log log n) = O(n log log n) algorithm, yielding OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(n log log n) and thus OPT/UB = O(log log n/log n) = o(1). This resolves the separation task (non-strong form).\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Prover 1: Drop the E_\u2113 approach; adopt the boundary/LCA charging. Provide a clean DFS UB = O(n) proof (charging to subtree sizes) and keep the bit-reversal status as \u03a9(n) with numerics for clarity.\n- Prover 2: Formalize rigorously: (i) the midpoint separation lemma; (ii) the bijection between consecutive pairs and node-boundaries via LCA; (iii) W1(T_ref) = O(n) including filler-node alternations. Then state the final theorem and corollary via Tango.\n- Both: Optional but valuable: attempt to strengthen OPT to O(n) (e.g., prove Greedy is O(n) on this 4-decomposable family or design a tailored BST with O(1) amortized per boundary). Also add empirical UB for \u03c0_h up to h\u224810 for constants.\n",

Prover 2 introduced a 2413-inflation family with a midpoint-first constraint and gave a correct UB lower bound by charging only at child-boundaries: UB(\u03c0_h)=\u0398(n log n). On the BST side, a tailored static reference tree yields Wilber-1 = O(n), so Tango achieves O(n log log n), giving OPT/UB = o(1). We can now formalize proofs to resolve the separation (non-strong).

Define m(I) := \u230a(a+b)/2\u230b.\n- Define recursively F_0(I) to be the unique element of I. For t \u2265 1, define F_t(I) to be the concatenation of the four subsequences S2 := F_{t\u22121}(I2), S4 := F_{t\u22121}(I4), S1 := F_{t\u22121}(I1), S3 := F_{t\u22121}(I3), with the inductive constraint that for every interval J of size 4^u, the first element of F_u(J) is m(J). This is consistent since F_{u\u22121}(Jk) begins with m(Jk).\n- The permutation \u03c0_h is F_h([1..4^h]). Let T be the 4-ary decomposition tree whose nodes are the intervals I encountered by the recursion; each internal node v has an interval I_v of size s_v and children I_v(1)<I_v(2)<I_v(3)<I_v(4).\n- For any internal node v, the restriction of \u03c0_h to keys in I_v is exactly S2 \u2218 S4 \u2218 S1 \u2218 S3, where Sk lists all keys in I_v(k) and no other keys.\n\nLemma 1 (Midpoint separation). Let v be an internal node with interval size s_v and let k \u2208 {1,2,3,4}. Let x be the first key of Sk in the restricted sequence at v. Then for any key y \u2209 I_v(k), |x \u2212 y| \u2265 s_v/8.\nProof. By construction, x = m(I_v(k)), the midpoint of the child interval I_v(k), whose length is s_v/4. The distance from the midpoint to any boundary of I_v(k) is s_v/8. If y lies in a sibling I_v(k\u2032), the closest such y is at the boundary between I_v(k) and I_v(k\u2032), hence |x\u2212y| \u2265 s_v/8. If y lies outside I_v, the closest such y is at a boundary of I_v, and the distance from x to that boundary is \u2265 s_v/8 as well. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Per-boundary UB). Let i be the global time index at which, within the restricted sequence for v, the traversal first enters child k (i.e., the boundary S?\u2192Sk at v). Then UB_i(\u03c0_h) \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8).\nProof. At time i there has been no prior access to any key in I_v(k) (the subsequence for I_v(k) occurs only within Sk and we are at the first element of Sk). Therefore every prior key y lies in I_v \\ I_v(k) or outside I_v. By Lemma 1, for all prior y we have |x_i \u2212 y| \u2265 s_v/8. Hence for all j \u2264 i\u22121, j + |x_i \u2212 x_{i\u2212j}| \u2265 s_v/8. Taking logs gives the claim. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Boundary\u2013transition bijection). For each i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n}, let v(i) be the lowest (deepest) node in T whose children contain x_{i\u22121} and x_i in two different children; equivalently, v(i) is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two leaves holding x_{i\u22121} and x_i. Then i is exactly one of the three child-boundary indices S2\u2192S4, S4\u2192S1, or S1\u2192S3 within the restricted sequence at v(i). Moreover, the mapping i \u21a6 v(i) is a bijection between {2,\u2026,n} and the multiset of all such boundaries over all internal nodes of T; in particular, the boundary indices over all nodes are pairwise distinct and their total number is n\u22121.\nProof. The restricted sequence at any internal node v is the concatenation S2 \u2218 S4 \u2218 S1 \u2218 S3, with no interleaving between different children. For any consecutive pair (x_{i\u22121}, x_i), there is a unique lowest node v whose children separate the two keys; at all descendants of v, the two keys lie in different subtrees, and at all ancestors they lie in the same child. Thus within the restriction to I_v the pair occurs at a boundary between two consecutive child blocks, necessarily one of S2\u2192S4, S4\u2192S1, S1\u2192S3. Distinct consecutive pairs have distinct LCAs, so the boundary indices are distinct across nodes. Counting gives exactly three boundaries per internal node and a total of (4^h\u22121) internal nodes divided by 3 levels in a full 4-ary tree, hence 3\u00b7|(internal nodes)| = 4^h \u2212 1 = n \u2212 1 boundaries, matching the number of consecutive pairs. \u220e\n\nTheorem 4 (UB lower bound). There exists a universal constant c > 0 such that UB(\u03c0_h) \u2265 c \u00b7 n \u00b7 log n.\nProof. By Lemma 3, the n\u22121 consecutive-pair indices are partitioned by internal nodes v, three per node. For each such index i associated with v, Lemma 2 gives UB_i \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8). Hence\nUB(\u03c0_h) \u2265 \u2211_{v internal} 3 \u00b7 log(1 + s_v/8).\nAt level \u2113 = 0,1,\u2026,h\u22121 (counting 0 at the root), there are 4^\u2113 internal nodes each with s_v = 4^{h\u2212\u2113}. Therefore\n\u2211_{v internal} log(1 + s_v/8) \u2265 \u2211_{\u2113=0}^{h\u22121} 4^\u2113 \u00b7 ( (h\u2212\u2113) \u00b7 log 4 \u2212 O(1) ) = \u0398( 4^h \u00b7 h ) = \u0398( n \u00b7 log n ).\nMultiplying by the constant factor 3 and adjusting constants yields UB(\u03c0_h) \u2265 c n log n. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Wilber-1 bound for a tailored reference tree). There exists a fixed static BST T_ref on [1..n] such that the Wilber-1 alternation bound W_1(T_ref, \u03c0_h) = O(n).\nConstruction and proof. Build T_ref recursively: for each internal node interval I_v, create a BST node that partitions keys into L_v := I_v(1) \u222a I_v(2) and R_v := I_v(3) \u222a I_v(4), and recurse on L_v and R_v. Complete this into a full BST by arbitrary binary splits inside the contiguous subintervals. For any decomposition node v, the sequence restricted to I_v visits L_v and R_v in the order L_v, R_v, L_v, R_v (since the child order is 2,4,1,3), yielding exactly 3 alternations at that partition. Each internal decomposition node thus contributes 3 alternations. The remaining filler nodes partition contiguous intervals that the sequence visits as a single block at that scale, hence each such node sees at most one alternation. Since the total number of nodes is O(n), W_1(T_ref, \u03c0_h) = O(n). \u220e\n\nCorollary 6 (BST upper bound). The Tango tree achieves cost O(W_1 \u00b7 log log n) against any fixed reference tree. With T_ref from Proposition 5, there is an explicit BST algorithm whose total cost on \u03c0_h is O(n log log n). Therefore OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(n log log n).\n\nConclusion. Combining Theorem 4 with the trivial UB(\u03c0_h) \u2264 n log(1+n) gives UB(\u03c0_h) = \u0398(n log n). Together with Corollary 6 we obtain OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) = o(UB(\u03c0_h)), resolving the separation task (non-strong form)."

Define a permutation \u03c0_h by recursively partitioning [1..n] into four equal contiguous key blocks I1<I2<I3<I4. The time order at each node is 2,4,1,3 (2413 inflation). Impose the midpoint-first constraint: for every interval J of size 4^t, the first key emitted by its subsequence is the midpoint m(J).\n\nUnified-bound lower bound\n- For an internal node v with interval size s_v, at the time i when the sequence first enters a child block within v (i.e., at boundaries S2\u2192S4, S4\u2192S1, S1\u2192S3), the accessed key x_i is the midpoint of that child. No earlier access lies in that child, hence every earlier key y is outside it. The midpoint is at rank-distance \u2265 s_v/8 from any such y. Therefore UB_i \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8).\n- Each pair of consecutive accesses (x_{i\u22121}, x_i) has a unique lowest common ancestor v in the 4-ary decomposition tree; within v\u2019s restricted sequence this pair occurs at one of the three child-boundaries. These boundary indices over all v are pairwise distinct and total n\u22121.\n- Summing UB_i over these n\u22121 indices yields \u2211_v 3\u00b7log(1 + s_v/8). There are 4^\u2113 nodes at level \u2113 with s_v = 4^{h\u2212\u2113}; thus the sum is \u0398(\u2211_{\u2113=0}^{h\u22121} 4^\u2113 (h\u2212\u2113)) = \u0398(n log n).

For any decomposition node, the restricted sequence visits L and R in the pattern L,R,L,R, so exactly 3 alternations occur at that partition. Filler nodes on contiguous intervals contribute at most one alternation each. Hence Wilber-1(T_ref, \u03c0_h) = O(n).\n- Tango trees achieve cost O(W_1 \u00b7 log log n) against any fixed reference tree. Therefore there is an explicit BST algorithm with total cost O(n log log n) on \u03c0_h, implying OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(n log log n).\n\nConclusion\n- The family {\u03c0_h} yields UB(\u03c0_h) = \u0398(n log n) while OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(n log log n). Consequently OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) / UB(\u03c0_h) = O(log log n / log n) = o(1), providing the requested separation (not yet the strongest O(n) vs \u03a9(n log n))."
