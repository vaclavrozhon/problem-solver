Prover 1 corrected bit-reversal to UB=Ω(n) but proposed a flawed UB(F_h) proof via per-level events; that approach must be dropped. Prover 2 introduced a 2413-inflation family with a midpoint-first constraint and gave a correct UB lower bound by charging only at child-boundaries: UB(π_h)=Θ(n log n). On the BST side, a tailored static reference tree yields Wilber-1 = O(n), so Tango achieves O(n log log n), giving OPT/UB = o(1). We can now formalize proofs to resolve the separation (non-strong). Next: finalize rigorous proofs (boundary/LCA mapping; W1 bound incl. filler nodes) and explore whether OPT can be improved to O(n) for a strong separation.
