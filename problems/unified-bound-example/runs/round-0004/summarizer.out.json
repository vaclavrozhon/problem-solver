  "summary_md": "Last round evaluated the 2413-inflation family (n=4^h) as a candidate separating OPT_BST from the unified bound. The Wilber\u20111 analysis is correct: with a tailored static tree W_1(\u03c0_h)=\u0398(n), so Tango trees give OPT_BST(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(n log log n). However the unified\u2011bound lower bound claim was wrong: the midpoint/LCA boundary charging and a key\u2011difference recurrence both yield UB(\u03c0_h)=\u0398(n), not \u0398(n log n). Earlier UB attempts (bit\u2011reversal, round\u2011robin blocks) were also shown flawed. Net: the family certifies small BST cost but not large UB, so no separation achieved yet. Next steps are to (i) search for a different family giving UB = \u03a9(n log n) while keeping W_1 = O(n) (or prove such families cannot exist among constant\u2011arity decomposable permutations), (ii) produce/cite a rigorous proof that DFS\u2011style permutations have UB = \u0398(n), and (iii) run numerical UB experiments for bit\u2011reversal and candidate families to guide theory.
