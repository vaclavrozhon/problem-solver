{"summary_md":"Last round evaluated the 2413-inflation family (n=4^h) as a candidate separating OPT_BST from the unified bound. The Wilber‑1 analysis is correct: with a tailored static tree W_1(π_h)=Θ(n), so Tango trees give OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n). However the unified‑bound lower bound claim was wrong: the midpoint/LCA boundary charging and a key‑difference recurrence both yield UB(π_h)=Θ(n), not Θ(n log n). Earlier UB attempts (bit‑reversal, round‑robin blocks) were also shown flawed. Net: the family certifies small BST cost but not large UB, so no separation achieved yet. Next steps are to (i) search for a different family giving UB = Ω(n log n) while keeping W_1 = O(n) (or prove such families cannot exist among constant‑arity decomposable permutations), (ii) produce/cite a rigorous proof that DFS‑style permutations have UB = Θ(n), and (iii) run numerical UB experiments for bit‑reversal and candidate families to guide theory.
