High-level verdict: the Wilber-1 part of output.md is correct (yields W1 = Θ(n), hence Tango cost O(n log log n)), but the unified-bound lower bound there is incorrect. The specific boundary/LCA charging claimed to give Θ(n log n) actually sums to only Θ(n). In fact, for the 2413-inflation family with equal-size 4-way splits, UB(π_h) = O(n). Thus the stated separation UB = Θ(n log n) vs OPT ≤ O(n log log n) does not hold for this family.

Details on Wilber-1: The reference BST that at each 4-ary node v splits (A∪B) vs (C∪D), then A vs B and C vs D, is valid. For v’s restricted sequence BDAC, the left/right pattern at the top split is L,R,L,R, giving exactly 3 alternations; at A vs B it is B then A (1 alternation); at C vs D it is D then C (1 alternation). No further alternations occur at these nodes because each block is a contiguous time segment. Since a full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n−1)/3 internal nodes, W1 = 5·(n−1)/3 = Θ(n). Tango then gives cost O(n log log n), so small-BST-cost is certified (up to log log n).

Unified bound: The boundary-midpoint argument does give, per 4-ary node v of size s_v, three indices with UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8). Summing over all nodes yields ∑_ℓ 4^ℓ·Θ(1 + h−ℓ) = Θ(4^h) = Θ(n), not Θ(n log n). The error in output.md is the step “∑_ℓ 4^ℓ (h−ℓ) = Θ(n log n)”; the correct value is Θ(n). Moreover, for this hierarchical concatenation (equal 4-way splits), there is a clean upper bound: UB_i ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|), and a recurrence over the decomposition tree shows S(π):=∑ log(2+|diff|) ≤ ∑_v 3 log(2 + s_v) = Θ(n). Hence UB(π_h) ≤ S(π_h) = O(n).

Consequences: The example does not realize large unified-bound cost; therefore it does not establish the desired separation. The small-cost (Wilber-1) certificate remains valid and useful as a target property, but we need a different family to achieve UB = Ω(n log n).

Next steps:
- Replace the UB claim for π_h with the correct UB(π_h) = Θ(n) bound; keep W1(π_h) = Θ(n).
- Either (a) search for a different family with UB = Ω(n log n) while maintaining W1 = O(n), or (b) attempt a structural theorem showing that W1 = O(n) on some fixed T_ref forces UB = O(n) for broad classes (e.g., constant-arity decomposable permutations). The latter would prune the search space decisively.
- If desired, we can include a calibration lemma: random permutations have E[UB] = Ω(n log n), but their W1 is also Θ(n log n) w.h.p., so they don’t serve our purpose.
