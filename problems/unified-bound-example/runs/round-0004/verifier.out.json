  "feedback_md": "High-level verdict: the Wilber-1 part of output.md is correct (yields W1 = \u0398(n), hence Tango cost O(n log log n)), but the unified-bound lower bound there is incorrect. The specific boundary/LCA charging claimed to give \u0398(n log n) actually sums to only \u0398(n). In fact, for the 2413-inflation family with equal-size 4-way splits, UB(\u03c0_h) = O(n). Thus the stated separation UB = \u0398(n log n) vs OPT \u2264 O(n log log n) does not hold for this family.\n\nDetails on Wilber-1: The reference BST that at each 4-ary node v splits (A\u222aB) vs (C\u222aD), then A vs B and C vs D, is valid. For v\u2019s restricted sequence BDAC, the left/right pattern at the top split is L,R,L,R, giving exactly 3 alternations; at A vs B it is B then A (1 alternation); at C vs D it is D then C (1 alternation). No further alternations occur at these nodes because each block is a contiguous time segment. Since a full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n\u22121)/3 internal nodes, W1 = 5\u00b7(n\u22121)/3 = \u0398(n). Tango then gives cost O(n log log n), so small-BST-cost is certified (up to log log n).\n\nUnified bound: The boundary-midpoint argument does give, per 4-ary node v of size s_v, three indices with UB_i \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8). Summing over all nodes yields \u2211_\u2113 4^\u2113\u00b7\u0398(1 + h\u2212\u2113) = \u0398(4^h) = \u0398(n), not \u0398(n log n). The error in output.md is the step \u201c\u2211_\u2113 4^\u2113 (h\u2212\u2113) = \u0398(n log n)\u201d; the correct value is \u0398(n). Moreover, for this hierarchical concatenation (equal 4-way splits), there is a clean upper bound: UB_i \u2264 log(2 + |x_i \u2212 x_{i\u22121}|), and a recurrence over the decomposition tree shows S(\u03c0):=\u2211 log(2+|diff|) \u2264 \u2211_v 3 log(2 + s_v) = \u0398(n). Hence UB(\u03c0_h) \u2264 S(\u03c0_h) = O(n).\n\nConsequences: The example does not realize large unified-bound cost; therefore it does not establish the desired separation. The small-cost (Wilber-1) certificate remains valid and useful as a target property, but we need a different family to achieve UB = \u03a9(n log n).\n\nNext steps:\n- Replace the UB claim for \u03c0_h with the correct UB(\u03c0_h) = \u0398(n) bound; keep W1(\u03c0_h) = \u0398(n).\n- Either (a) search for a different family with UB = \u03a9(n log n) while maintaining W1 = O(n), or (b) attempt a structural theorem showing that W1 = O(n) on some fixed T_ref forces UB = O(n) for broad classes (e.g., constant-arity decomposable permutations). The latter would prune the search space decisively.\n- If desired, we can include a calibration lemma: random permutations have E[UB] = \u03a9(n log n), but their W1 is also \u0398(n log n) w.h.p., so they don\u2019t serve our purpose.\n",

This is independent of sizes. A full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n\u22121)/3 internal nodes, so W_1 = 5\u00b7(n\u22121)/3 = \u0398(n). Tango yields cost O(n log log n).\n\n- Unified bound: The boundary-midpoint argument only yields UB_i \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8) for three indices per node v (s_v = interval size). Summing gives \u2211_\u2113 4^\u2113\u00b7\u0398(1 + h\u2212\u2113) = \u0398(n), not \u0398(n log n). The mistake in the earlier output was claiming \u2211_\u2113 4^\u2113 (h\u2212\u2113) = \u0398(n log n); it is \u0398(n). Moreover, UB_i \u2264 log(2 + |x_i \u2212 x_{i\u22121}|).

The small BST cost certificate (W_1 = \u0398(n)) remains valid.\n\n- Next directions: (i) Seek a different family achieving UB = \u03a9(n log n) with W_1 = O(n). (ii) Alternatively, prove a limitation: in broad classes (e.g., constant-arity decomposable permutations with uniform shrink), W_1 = O(n) implies UB = O(n). (iii) For calibration, random permutations satisfy E[UB] = \u03a9(n log n) but also have W_1 = \u0398(n log n) w.h.p., hence unsuitable for our goal.\n"

    "content": "2413-inflation: Wilber-1 = \u0398(n) and Unified Bound = O(n)\n\nSetup and notation\n- Universe: keys [n] with n = 4^h. At every internal node of a 4-ary decomposition tree, an interval J of size 4^t is partitioned into four equal contiguous subintervals A(J) < B(J) < C(J) < D(J), each of size 4^{t-1}. The permutation \u03c0_h is obtained by concatenation in the fixed order B(J) then D(J) then A(J) then C(J), and recursing identically within each child.\n- Wilber-1 uses a fixed reference BST T. For a node w of T, alt(w) is the number of alternations between the left vs right subtree when scanning the access sequence restricted to w\u2019s keys; W_1(T,\u03c0) := \u2211_w alt(w).\n- The unified bound on permutations is UB(\u03c0) := \u2211_{i=1}^n UB_i(\u03c0) where UB_i(\u03c0) := log(1 + min_{1\u2264j\u2264i-1} (j + |x_i \u2212 R_i(j)|)), R_i(j) being the j-th most recent prior key. For i\u22652, UB_i(\u03c0) \u2264 log(2 + |x_i \u2212 x_{i\u22121}|) by choosing j=1.\n\nTheorem 1 (Wilber-1 is linear).\nConstruct a static reference BST T_ref recursively as follows. For any 4-ary node with children A<B<C<D:\n- Create a node that splits L := A\u222aB (left) vs R := C\u222aD (right).\n- In its left subtree, create a node splitting A vs B; in its right subtree, a node splitting C vs D.\n- Recurse within A, B, C, D.\nThen W_1(T_ref, \u03c0_h) = 5\u00b7(n\u22121)/3 = \u0398(n).\n\nProof.\nFix an internal 4-ary node v with restricted time order B | D | A | C. Consider the three binary nodes in T_ref associated with v:\n- At the top split L vs R, the side sequence is L (block B), R (D), L (A), R (C), so alt = 3.\n- At the A-vs-B split (left child of the top split), the restricted sequence is B then A, so alt = 1.\n- At the C-vs-D split (right child), the restricted sequence is D then C, so alt = 1.\nWithin each block, all accesses remain on one side of these three splits, so no further alternations accrue at these nodes. Each 4-ary node contributes exactly 3+1+1=5 to W_1. A full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n\u22121)/3 internal nodes, hence W_1(T_ref, \u03c0_h) = 5\u00b7(n\u22121)/3. \u220e\n\nCorollary 2 (BST algorithmic bound).\nTango trees achieve cost O(W_1(T_ref) \u00b7 log log n) on any access sequence. Therefore there is an explicit dynamic BST with total cost O(n log log n) on \u03c0_h.\n\nTheorem 3 (Unified bound is linear for \u03c0_h).\nUB(\u03c0_h) = O(n).\n\nProof.\nLet S(\u03c0) := \u2211_{i=2}^{n} log(2 + |x_i \u2212 x_{i\u22121}|). Since UB_i(\u03c0) \u2264 log(2 + |x_i \u2212 x_{i\u22121}|) for i\u22652, we have UB(\u03c0) \u2264 log(1+n) + S(\u03c0) = O(1) + S(\u03c0). It suffices to show S(\u03c0_h) = O(n).\n\nFor any 4-ary node v with interval I_v of size s_v, write the restricted sequence as a concatenation \u03c0(B) \u25e6 \u03c0(D) \u25e6 \u03c0(A) \u25e6 \u03c0(C). Then the sum S over consecutive pairs occurring within I_v decomposes exactly as\nS(\u03c0(v)) = S(\u03c0(B)) + S(\u03c0(D)) + S(\u03c0(A)) + S(\u03c0(C))\n          + log(2 + |last(B) \u2212 first(D)|)\n          + log(2 + |last(D) \u2212 first(A)|)\n          + log(2 + |last(A) \u2212 first(C)|),\nwhere first(\u00b7), last(\u00b7) denote the first and last keys (in time) of each child block. Since these two keys lie in adjacent contiguous subintervals of I_v, their key-distance is at most s_v. Hence\nS(\u03c0(v)) \u2264 S(\u03c0(B)) + S(\u03c0(D)) + S(\u03c0(A)) + S(\u03c0(C)) + 3 \u00b7 log(2 + s_v).\nApplying this recurrence from the root down to leaves (where S=0) telescopes and yields\nS(\u03c0_h) \u2264 \u2211_{v internal} 3 \u00b7 log(2 + s_v).\nAt level \u2113 (root at \u2113=0), there are 4^\u2113 nodes with s_v = 4^{h\u2212\u2113}; thus\nS(\u03c0_h) \u2264 3 \u2211_{\u2113=0}^{h\u22121} 4^\u2113 \u00b7 ( (h\u2212\u2113)\u00b7log 4 + O(1) ) = O(4^h) = O(n).\nTherefore UB(\u03c0_h) \u2264 O(1) + S(\u03c0_h) = O(n). \u220e\n\nRemark 4 (Boundary lower bound is only linear).\nIf, additionally, one enforces a midpoint-first rule inside each child, then at the three child-boundary times in v\u2019s restricted sequence the accessed key is at key-distance \u2265 s_v/8 from any earlier key in I_v. This gives UB_i \u2265 log(1 + s_v/8) at 3 indices per v. Summing over all 4-ary nodes gives \u2211_{\u2113=0}^{h\u22121} 4^\u2113\u00b7\u0398(1 + h\u2212\u2113) = \u0398(n), not \u0398(n log n).\n\nConclusion.\nFor the 2413-inflation family, W_1(T_ref, \u03c0_h) = \u0398(n) (hence there exists a BST with O(n log log n) cost), while the unified bound satisfies UB(\u03c0_h) = O(n). The family does not realize UB = \u0398(n log n).\n"
