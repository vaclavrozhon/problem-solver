Wilber-1 analysis for the 2413-inflation family is correct and gives W1 = Θ(n), hence Tango cost O(n log log n). The unified-bound lower bound in output.md is incorrect: boundary charging sums to Θ(n), and a direct recurrence shows UB(π_h) = O(n). Therefore the claimed UB = Θ(n log n) does not hold; the example fails to deliver the intended separation. Keep the W1 result; replace the UB claim; and seek a different family (or prove a structural limitation) to obtain UB = Ω(n log n) with W1 = O(n).
