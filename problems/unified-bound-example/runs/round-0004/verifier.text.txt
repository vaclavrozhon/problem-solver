{"feedback_md":"High-level verdict: the Wilber-1 part of output.md is correct (yields W1 = Θ(n), hence Tango cost O(n log log n)), but the unified-bound lower bound there is incorrect. The specific boundary/LCA charging claimed to give Θ(n log n) actually sums to only Θ(n). In fact, for the 2413-inflation family with equal-size 4-way splits, UB(π_h) = O(n). Thus the stated separation UB = Θ(n log n) vs OPT ≤ O(n log log n) does not hold for this family.\n\nDetails on Wilber-1: The reference BST that at each 4-ary node v splits (A∪B) vs (C∪D), then A vs B and C vs D, is valid. For v’s restricted sequence BDAC, the left/right pattern at the top split is L,R,L,R, giving exactly 3 alternations; at A vs B it is B then A (1 alternation); at C vs D it is D then C (1 alternation). No further alternations occur at these nodes because each block is a contiguous time segment. Since a full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n−1)/3 internal nodes, W1 = 5·(n−1)/3 = Θ(n). Tango then gives cost O(n log log n), so small-BST-cost is certified (up to log log n).\n\nUnified bound: The boundary-midpoint argument does give, per 4-ary node v of size s_v, three indices with UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8). Summing over all nodes yields ∑_ℓ 4^ℓ·Θ(1 + h−ℓ) = Θ(4^h) = Θ(n), not Θ(n log n). The error in output.md is the step “∑_ℓ 4^ℓ (h−ℓ) = Θ(n log n)”; the correct value is Θ(n). Moreover, for this hierarchical concatenation (equal 4-way splits), there is a clean upper bound: UB_i ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|), and a recurrence over the decomposition tree shows S(π):=∑ log(2+|diff|) ≤ ∑_v 3 log(2 + s_v) = Θ(n). Hence UB(π_h) ≤ S(π_h) = O(n).\n\nConsequences: The example does not realize large unified-bound cost; therefore it does not establish the desired separation. The small-cost (Wilber-1) certificate remains valid and useful as a target property, but we need a different family to achieve UB = Ω(n log n).\n\nNext steps:\n- Replace the UB claim for π_h with the correct UB(π_h) = Θ(n) bound; keep W1(π_h) = Θ(n).\n- Either (a) search for a different family with UB = Ω(n log n) while maintaining W1 = O(n), or (b) attempt a structural theorem showing that W1 = O(n) on some fixed T_ref forces UB = O(n) for broad classes (e.g., constant-arity decomposable permutations). The latter would prune the search space decisively.\n- If desired, we can include a calibration lemma: random permutations have E[UB] = Ω(n log n), but their W1 is also Θ(n log n) w.h.p., so they don’t serve our purpose.\n","summary_md":"Wilber-1 analysis for the 2413-inflation family is correct and gives W1 = Θ(n), hence Tango cost O(n log log n).

At every internal node of a 4-ary decomposition tree, an interval J of size 4^t is partitioned into four equal contiguous subintervals A(J) < B(J) < C(J) < D(J), each of size 4^{t-1}. The permutation π_h is obtained by concatenation in the fixed order B(J) then D(J) then A(J) then C(J), and recursing identically within each child.\n- Wilber-1 uses a fixed reference BST T. For a node w of T, alt(w) is the number of alternations between the left vs right subtree when scanning the access sequence restricted to w’s keys; W_1(T,π) := ∑_w alt(w).\n- The unified bound on permutations is UB(π) := ∑_{i=1}^n UB_i(π) where UB_i(π) := log(1 + min_{1≤j≤i-1} (j + |x_i − R_i(j)|)), R_i(j) being the j-th most recent prior key. For i≥2, UB_i(π) ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|) by choosing j=1.\n\nTheorem 1 (Wilber-1 is linear).\nConstruct a static reference BST T_ref recursively as follows. For any 4-ary node with children A<B<C<D:\n- Create a node that splits L := A∪B (left) vs R := C∪D (right).\n- In its left subtree, create a node splitting A vs B; in its right subtree, a node splitting C vs D.\n- Recurse within A, B, C, D.\nThen W_1(T_ref, π_h) = 5·(n−1)/3 = Θ(n).\n\nProof.\nFix an internal 4-ary node v with restricted time order B | D | A | C. Consider the three binary nodes in T_ref associated with v:\n- At the top split L vs R, the side sequence is L (block B), R (D), L (A), R (C), so alt = 3.\n- At the A-vs-B split (left child of the top split), the restricted sequence is B then A, so alt = 1.\n- At the C-vs-D split (right child), the restricted sequence is D then C, so alt = 1.\nWithin each block, all accesses remain on one side of these three splits, so no further alternations accrue at these nodes. Each 4-ary node contributes exactly 3+1+1=5 to W_1. A full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n−1)/3 internal nodes, hence W_1(T_ref, π_h) = 5·(n−1)/3. ∎\n\nCorollary 2 (BST algorithmic bound).\nTango trees achieve cost O(W_1(T_ref) · log log n) on any access sequence. Therefore there is an explicit dynamic BST with total cost O(n log log n) on π_h.\n\nTheorem 3 (Unified bound is linear for π_h).\nUB(π_h) = O(n).\n\nProof.\nLet S(π) := ∑_{i=2}^{n} log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|). Since UB_i(π) ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|) for i≥2, we have UB(π) ≤ log(1+n) + S(π) = O(1) + S(π). It suffices to show S(π_h) = O(n).\n\nFor any 4-ary node v with interval I_v of size s_v, write the restricted sequence as a concatenation π(B) ◦ π(D) ◦ π(A) ◦ π(C). Then the sum S over consecutive pairs occurring within I_v decomposes exactly as\nS(π(v)) = S(π(B)) + S(π(D)) + S(π(A)) + S(π(C))\n          + log(2 + |last(B) − first(D)|)\n          + log(2 + |last(D) − first(A)|)\n          + log(2 + |last(A) − first(C)|),\nwhere first(·), last(·) denote the first and last keys (in time) of each child block. Since these two keys lie in adjacent contiguous subintervals of I_v, their key-distance is at most s_v. Hence\nS(π(v)) ≤ S(π(B)) + S(π(D)) + S(π(A)) + S(π(C)) + 3 · log(2 + s_v).\nApplying this recurrence from the root down to leaves (where S=0) telescopes and yields\nS(π_h) ≤ ∑_{v internal} 3 · log(2 + s_v).\nAt level ℓ (root at ℓ=0), there are 4^ℓ nodes with s_v = 4^{h−ℓ}; thus\nS(π_h) ≤ 3 ∑_{ℓ=0}^{h−1} 4^ℓ · ( (h−ℓ)·log 4 + O(1) ) = O(4^h) = O(n).\nTherefore UB(π_h) ≤ O(1) + S(π_h) = O(n). ∎\n\nRemark 4 (Boundary lower bound is only linear).\nIf, additionally, one enforces a midpoint-first rule inside each child, then at the three child-boundary times in v’s restricted sequence the accessed key is at key-distance ≥ s_v/8 from any earlier key in I_v. This gives UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8) at 3 indices per v. Summing over all 4-ary nodes gives ∑_{ℓ=0}^{h−1} 4^ℓ·Θ(1 + h−ℓ) = Θ(n), not Θ(n log n).\n\nConclusion.\nFor the 2413-inflation family, W_1(T_ref, π_h) = Θ(n) (hence there exists a BST with O(n log log n) cost), while the unified bound satisfies UB(π_h) = O(n). The family does not realize UB = Θ(n log n).\n"},"output_update":null}
