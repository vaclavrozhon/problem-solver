# Permutation UB-vs-OPT Separation Problem

**Universe.** Keys are $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ with the usual order.
An **instance** is a permutation $\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of $[n]$.

## 1) Unified-bound cost on a permutation

For each time $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$:

* Let $R_i(1),R_i(2),\dots,R_i(i-1)$ be the previously accessed keys ordered by **recency** (so $R_i(1)=x_{i-1}$, $R_i(2)=x_{i-2}$, …).
* Define the **rank distance** $\Delta_i(j) := |\,x_i - R_i(j)\,|$.
* The **per-access unified charge** is

  $$
  \mathrm{UB}_i(\pi)\;:=\;\log\!\Big(1+\min_{1\le j\le i-1}\big(j+\Delta_i(j)\big)\Big),
  $$

  with the convention $\mathrm{UB}_1(\pi):=\log(1+n)$.

The **total unified-bound cost** is

$$
\mathrm{UB}(\pi):=\sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{UB}_i(\pi).
$$

*(Remarks: logs are base 2; constants are irrelevant for asymptotics. Because $\pi$ is a permutation, “working-set number” equals the recency rank $j$, so this is the standard unified bound specialized to permutations.)*

## 2) Optimal dynamic BST cost on a permutation

We use the standard **dynamic BST model**:

* The algorithm maintains a binary search tree $T$ over $[n]$.
* To access $x_i$, it traverses parent/child pointers from the root to $x_i$; pointer moves and comparisons along the search path each cost 1.
* After (or during) the access, it may perform any number of **rotations**, each costing 1.
* The initial tree is a fixed balanced BST on $[n]$. (Allowing an arbitrary offline choice changes costs by at most an additive $O(n)$ and doesn’t affect asymptotics for this problem.)

For a permutation $\pi$, the **cost of an algorithm $\mathcal A$** is the sum of search-path lengths plus rotations over the $n$ accesses. The **optimal BST cost** is

$$
\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{BST}}(\pi):=\min_{\mathcal A}\;\text{cost}_{\mathcal A}(\pi).
$$

## 3) The separation task

Find an infinite family of permutations $\{\pi_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, $\pi_n\in S_n$, such that

$$
\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{BST}}(\pi_n)\;=\;o\!\big(\mathrm{UB}(\pi_n)\big)
\quad\text{as }n\to\infty.
$$

A **strong separation** would meet, for some constants $c,C>0$,

$$
\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{BST}}(\pi_n)\;\le\; C n
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\mathrm{UB}(\pi_n)\;\ge\; c\,n\log n,
$$

i.e., $ \mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{BST}}(\pi_n) / \mathrm{UB}(\pi_n) = O(1/\log n)$.

*(Equivalently, in per-access terms: find $\pi_n$ with average BST cost $o(1)\cdot$UB’s average, e.g. $O(1)$ vs $\Omega(\log n)$.)*

# Research Notes



# Corrections and guidance

- Bit-reversal UB lower bound (Prover 1): The argument via t = ν2(i−1) shows UB_i ≥ log(min{2^t, 2^{h−t−1}}) = min{t, h−t−1} − O(1). With Pr[t=k]=2^{−(k+1)}, we have E[min{t,h−t−1}] = ∑_{k=0}^{h−1} 2^{−(k+1)} min{k, h−k−1} = O(1). Therefore this line of reasoning yields only UB(π) = Ω(n), not Ω(n log n). The step claiming Θ(h) per step is incorrect.

- DFS UB = Θ(n) (Prover 1): The sketch using UB_i ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|) is plausible but needs a clean proof. Suggested route: charge log differences to subtree sizes along the DFS traversal and show ∑_v O(log size(v)) = O(n).

- Round-robin block construction (Prover 2): The per-step lower bound min_j (j + |x_i − x_{i−j}|) ≥ ⌊b/2⌋ for all i beyond the first round is false. Counterexample pattern (general b): choose within-block σ_b with (c_2, c_3) = (1, b). For any block B_r at round t=3, let s be the adjacent block that comes after r in ρ_k. Then the last access to B_s was at round t=2 with key c_2=1, so Δ = b + c_2 − c_3 = 1. The corresponding j equals k + pos(r) − pos(s) − 1 ≤ k−1, hence j + Δ ≤ k. When k ≪ b, this is < b/2, contradicting the claimed bound. In fact, many t produce such small witnesses, so UB_i can be O(log k) frequently.

- Fractal 2413 family (Prover 1): BST side is promising if we can cite or prove that Greedy runs in O(n) on permutations whose substitution decomposition uses only simple nodes of size ≤ 4. The UB lower bound must be scale-based: for many i, show that all candidates among the last L (for L ≈ the size of a relevant block scale) are far in key, so min_j (j+Δ) = Ω(L), giving UB_i = Ω(log L). The naive “first-arrival per block” charge yields only O(n) total and is insufficient.

- Next steps:
  1) Provide a rigorous DFS UB=O(n) proof or a citation.
  2) Correct the bit-reversal UB claim; add numerical UB for n = 2^h up to h ≈ 14–16.
  3) For F_h, (a) verify/cite Greedy’s O(n) bound for k-decomposable (k=4), (b) develop and prove a proper scale-based UB lower bound, and (c) compute UB empirically for h up to 8–10.
  4) Abandon the round-robin block family for UB ≈ n log(n/k); its structure lets adjacent-block, previous-round witnesses keep UB_i = O(log k) too often.


New candidate family and fix to UB lower bound

- Adopt the recursively interleaved 2413-inflation family π_h on n=4^h keys with the midpoint-first constraint: at every interval J of size 4^t, the first key emitted by F_t(J) is the midpoint m(J); and at each node, the time order of children is 2,4,1,3.
- UB lower bound strategy: charge only at child-boundary steps within each node’s restricted sequence (S2→S4, S4→S1, S1→S3). At the first key of a child, all previous accesses are outside that child; the midpoint ensures a rank-distance ≥ s_v/8 to any earlier key, where s_v is the parent interval size. Thus UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8) at those steps.
- Counting without double counting: each consecutive pair (x_{i−1}, x_i) has a unique lowest common ancestor v in the 4-ary decomposition tree; this pair coincides with exactly one such boundary at v. Hence the boundary times over all nodes are disjoint and total n−1.
- Summing over nodes gives UB(π_h) ≥ Θ(n log n); the trivial UB ≤ n log n yields UB(π_h) = Θ(n log n).
- BST side: choose a static reference BST that recursively splits {I1∪I2} vs {I3∪I4}. At each decomposition node, the restricted sequence is L,R,L,R, so exactly 3 alternations. Filling contiguous intervals into a full BST contributes O(1) alternations per filler node. Hence Wilber-1 = O(n). Tango yields an explicit algorithm with cost O(n log log n).
- Correction: The earlier per-level event argument (choosing t in the first quarter of D and claiming t−j lies in B for j ≤ s) is false; those t−j remain in D. The boundary/LCA charging avoids this pitfall.
- Next: formalize the LCA-based bijection and the filler-node alternation accounting; attempt to improve OPT to O(n) (Greedy or tailored BST).

Update on the 2413-inflation family (n=4^h)

- Wilber-1: Using a reference BST that, at each 4-ary node v with children A<B<C<D, splits (A∪B) vs (C∪D), then A vs B and C vs D, the alternations at v’s restricted sequence BDAC are: 3 at the top split (L,R,L,R) and 1 each at A-vs-B and C-vs-D. This is independent of sizes. A full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n−1)/3 internal nodes, so W_1 = 5·(n−1)/3 = Θ(n). Tango yields cost O(n log log n).

- Unified bound: The boundary-midpoint argument only yields UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8) for three indices per node v (s_v = interval size). Summing gives ∑_ℓ 4^ℓ·Θ(1 + h−ℓ) = Θ(n), not Θ(n log n). The mistake in the earlier output was claiming ∑_ℓ 4^ℓ (h−ℓ) = Θ(n log n); it is Θ(n). Moreover, UB_i ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|). For equal-size 4-way splits, a recurrence over the decomposition shows S(π):=∑ log(2+|diff|) ≤ ∑_v 3 log(2 + s_v) = Θ(n), hence UB(π_h) = O(n).

- Conclusion: 2413-inflation does not realize large UB; it actually has UB = Θ(n). The small BST cost certificate (W_1 = Θ(n)) remains valid.

- Next directions: (i) Seek a different family achieving UB = Ω(n log n) with W_1 = O(n). (ii) Alternatively, prove a limitation: in broad classes (e.g., constant-arity decomposable permutations with uniform shrink), W_1 = O(n) implies UB = O(n). (iii) For calibration, random permutations satisfy E[UB] = Ω(n log n) but also have W_1 = Θ(n log n) w.h.p., hence unsuitable for our goal.

# Main Results



Result: An explicit permutation family with UB = Θ(n log n) and OPT_BST ≤ O(n log log n)

Setup
- Let n = 4^h. Define a permutation π_h by recursively partitioning [1..n] into four equal contiguous key blocks I1<I2<I3<I4. The time order at each node is 2,4,1,3 (2413 inflation). Impose the midpoint-first constraint: for every interval J of size 4^t, the first key emitted by its subsequence is the midpoint m(J).

Unified-bound lower bound
- For an internal node v with interval size s_v, at the time i when the sequence first enters a child block within v (i.e., at boundaries S2→S4, S4→S1, S1→S3), the accessed key x_i is the midpoint of that child. No earlier access lies in that child, hence every earlier key y is outside it. The midpoint is at rank-distance ≥ s_v/8 from any such y. Therefore UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8).
- Each pair of consecutive accesses (x_{i−1}, x_i) has a unique lowest common ancestor v in the 4-ary decomposition tree; within v’s restricted sequence this pair occurs at one of the three child-boundaries. These boundary indices over all v are pairwise distinct and total n−1.
- Summing UB_i over these n−1 indices yields ∑_v 3·log(1 + s_v/8). There are 4^ℓ nodes at level ℓ with s_v = 4^{h−ℓ}; thus the sum is Θ(∑_{ℓ=0}^{h−1} 4^ℓ (h−ℓ)) = Θ(n log n). Since trivially UB(π_h) ≤ n log(1+n), we conclude UB(π_h) = Θ(n log n).

BST upper bound
- Fix a static reference BST T_ref that, at each node of the decomposition, splits keys into L := I1∪I2 and R := I3∪I4 and recurses; fill contiguous subintervals arbitrarily to form a full BST. For any decomposition node, the restricted sequence visits L and R in the pattern L,R,L,R, so exactly 3 alternations occur at that partition. Filler nodes on contiguous intervals contribute at most one alternation each. Hence Wilber-1(T_ref, π_h) = O(n).
- Tango trees achieve cost O(W_1 · log log n) against any fixed reference tree. Therefore there is an explicit BST algorithm with total cost O(n log log n) on π_h, implying OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n).

Conclusion
- The family {π_h} yields UB(π_h) = Θ(n log n) while OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n). Consequently OPT_BST(π_h) / UB(π_h) = O(log log n / log n) = o(1), providing the requested separation (not yet the strongest O(n) vs Ω(n log n)).


=== Round 1 Summary ===

Reviewer notes: Several proposed UB-vs-OPT separation constructions were re-evaluated. The bit-reversal lower-bound argument is flawed — it only yields UB(π)=Ω(n), not Ω(n log n). DFS-order permutations likely satisfy UB=Θ(n), but a rigorous proof is needed (suggestion: charge log|x_i−x_{i−1}| to subtree sizes along the DFS traversal). The round-robin block construction’s key per-step UB bound is false: adjacent-block, previous-round witnesses make many UB_i=O(log k), so UB≈n log k rather than n log(n/k). The fractal 2413 (k=4) family remains the most promising candidate: Greedy may achieve OPT=O(n) if the substitution decomposition uses only simple nodes of size ≤4, but the UB lower bound requires a scale-based argument that forces min_j(j+Δ)=Ω(L) at relevant scales. Next steps: formalize/cite DFS UB=O(n); recompute/correct bit-reversal numerics (n=2^h up to h≈14–16); for F_h prove/verify Greedy O(n), develop scale-based UB lower bounds, and run UB experiments (h≤8–10).

=== Round 2 Summary ===

Last round corrected earlier mistakes (bit-reversal and round-robin families) and introduced a new explicit permutation family π_h (n=4^h): a recursively interleaved 2413-inflation with a midpoint-first constraint and child order 2,4,1,3. UB lower bound: charge only at child-boundary times and use an LCA/bijection between consecutive pairs and node-boundaries; midpoints give rank-distance ≥ s_v/8 to any earlier key, so those boundary steps contribute Θ(log s_v). Summing over levels yields UB(π_h)=Θ(n log n). BST upper bound: choose a static reference tree that splits (I1∪I2) vs (I3∪I4) recursively; each decomposition node produces O(1) alternations so Wilber-1 = O(n). Tango trees then give an explicit algorithm with cost O(n log log n), hence OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n). This achieves OPT = o(UB) (non-strong separation). Next formal tasks: make the LCA/boundary bijection and Wilber-1/filler-node accounting fully rigorous. Citations: "Corrections and guidance"; "Current Proofs".


=== Round 4 Summary ===

Last round evaluated the 2413-inflation family (n=4^h) as a candidate separating OPT_BST from the unified bound. The Wilber‑1 analysis is correct: with a tailored static tree W_1(π_h)=Θ(n), so Tango trees give OPT_BST(π_h) ≤ O(n log log n). However the unified‑bound lower bound claim was wrong: the midpoint/LCA boundary charging and a key‑difference recurrence both yield UB(π_h)=Θ(n), not Θ(n log n). Earlier UB attempts (bit‑reversal, round‑robin blocks) were also shown flawed. Net: the family certifies small BST cost but not large UB, so no separation achieved yet. Next steps are to (i) search for a different family giving UB = Ω(n log n) while keeping W_1 = O(n) (or prove such families cannot exist among constant‑arity decomposable permutations), (ii) produce/cite a rigorous proof that DFS‑style permutations have UB = Θ(n), and (iii) run numerical UB experiments for bit‑reversal and candidate families to guide theory.

=== Previous Round Feedback ===

High-level verdict: the Wilber-1 part of output.md is correct (yields W1 = Θ(n), hence Tango cost O(n log log n)), but the unified-bound lower bound there is incorrect. The specific boundary/LCA charging claimed to give Θ(n log n) actually sums to only Θ(n). In fact, for the 2413-inflation family with equal-size 4-way splits, UB(π_h) = O(n). Thus the stated separation UB = Θ(n log n) vs OPT ≤ O(n log log n) does not hold for this family.

Details on Wilber-1: The reference BST that at each 4-ary node v splits (A∪B) vs (C∪D), then A vs B and C vs D, is valid. For v’s restricted sequence BDAC, the left/right pattern at the top split is L,R,L,R, giving exactly 3 alternations; at A vs B it is B then A (1 alternation); at C vs D it is D then C (1 alternation). No further alternations occur at these nodes because each block is a contiguous time segment. Since a full 4-ary tree with n leaves has (n−1)/3 internal nodes, W1 = 5·(n−1)/3 = Θ(n). Tango then gives cost O(n log log n), so small-BST-cost is certified (up to log log n).

Unified bound: The boundary-midpoint argument does give, per 4-ary node v of size s_v, three indices with UB_i ≥ log(1 + s_v/8). Summing over all nodes yields ∑_ℓ 4^ℓ·Θ(1 + h−ℓ) = Θ(4^h) = Θ(n), not Θ(n log n). The error in output.md is the step “∑_ℓ 4^ℓ (h−ℓ) = Θ(n log n)”; the correct value is Θ(n). Moreover, for this hierarchical concatenation (equal 4-way splits), there is a clean upper bound: UB_i ≤ log(2 + |x_i − x_{i−1}|), and a recurrence over the decomposition tree shows S(π):=∑ log(2+|diff|) ≤ ∑_v 3 log(2 + s_v) = Θ(n). Hence UB(π_h) ≤ S(π_h) = O(n).

Consequences: The example does not realize large unified-bound cost; therefore it does not establish the desired separation. The small-cost (Wilber-1) certificate remains valid and useful as a target property, but we need a different family to achieve UB = Ω(n log n).

Next steps:
- Replace the UB claim for π_h with the correct UB(π_h) = Θ(n) bound; keep W1(π_h) = Θ(n).
- Either (a) search for a different family with UB = Ω(n log n) while maintaining W1 = O(n), or (b) attempt a structural theorem showing that W1 = O(n) on some fixed T_ref forces UB = O(n) for broad classes (e.g., constant-arity decomposable permutations). The latter would prune the search space decisively.
- If desired, we can include a calibration lemma: random permutations have E[UB] = Ω(n log n), but their W1 is also Θ(n log n) w.h.p., so they don’t serve our purpose.
